 Lao People's Democratic Republic,,,,,,,,,,"Since 9 July 1999 we have seen renewed tension in
the Taiwan Strait. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic
reaffirms its consistent position that Taiwan is an integral
and inalienable part of China, and that the Government of
the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal and
legitimate representative of the entire Chinese people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bahamas ,,,,,"It is from this perspective that the Bahamas supports
the efforts of the Republic of China to entreat the
Organization to examine the merits of establishing an ad
hoc committee to analyse comprehensively the current
implications and future ramifications of the preclusion of
the 21 million people in the Republic of China from
contributing to, and availing themselves of, all the
benefits deriving from membership in the United Nations
and its affiliated agencies. Our Organization is expected
to reflect universality and to demonstrate impartiality
when forging international agreements for policy
commitments, for accessing resources and for action.","Once again, the Bahamas wishes to record its support
for the entreaties made by the Republic of China on Taiwan
to this Organization to examine the merits of establishing
an ad hoc committee to analyse comprehensively the
current implications and future ramifications of the
preclusion of the 21 million people in the Republic of
China from contributing to, and availing themselves of, all
the benefits derived from membership in the United Nations
and its affiliated agencies. The Bahamas also lends its voice
to those who encourage dialogue and meaningful
confidence-building steps between the People’s Republic of
China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.","It is in this spirit of justice and fair play that over the
past two years we have repeatedly recorded our support in
the General Assembly for the efforts of the 21 million
inhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan as they
entreat the Organization to examine the merits of
establishing a committee to analyse in depth the
implications, both now and for the future, of continuing to
preclude those 21 million souls from formal representation
in the General Assembly by way of membership in the
United Nations.
The Bahamas again calls on the nations of the world,
as Members of this august and united international body of
nations, to hear the plea of those 21 million souls on the
island of Taiwan and to consider what is just and right for them as they too seek to avail themselves of the benefits
of membership in the United Nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Belize ,,,,,,,"From this geopolitical vantage point as well, we see
East Asia as a partner to the Caribbean and Central
America. This helps us appreciate that the contemporary
approach to statehood fully justifies the aspirations of a
democratic Asian country that is one of the most
substantial players in the global economy for a greater
measure of political participation in the system of
international organizations. That country is Taiwan. In the
view of my delegation, such participation would be quite
consistent with prevailing notions of sovereignty. At the
same time, it is assumed that the territorial integrity of the
People’s Republic of China would be completely
unimpaired. We believe that the statehood and dignity of
the latter ancient, honourable and global Power should
and would be safeguarded in any situation we have
posited. Without meaning to interfere, we would hope
that, in this connection, as has been stated in other
contexts in these remarks, noblesse oblige.","On another issue related to reform, the principles of
equitability and universality confer urgency on the claim
for consideration of the Republic of China on Taiwan.
Twenty-one million people living in a successful, robust
and prosperous democracy should be entitled at the very
least to a discussion of their circumstances. The blanket
“no”, the annual ritual that continues to slam the door
shut on even the possibility of debating their aspirations,
is irrational and unenlightened. A way must be found to
review this situation in a manner consistent with the
rights of the parties and the spirit of the Charter.","Belize supports the efforts of the Republic of China
on Taiwan to participate fully in the work of this
Organization and its organs, as well as in international
financial and developmental institutions. The time has
come for us to respect the sovereign will of that
population, in conformity with the universalist principles
of our Charter.","Effective solidarity between the haves and the have
nots is an essential part of the solution to the problems of
marginalization and poverty. That is why we commend the
actions of the Republic of China on Taiwan, which has not
been reluctant to help less well-endowed countries. Taiwan
is a good friend of Belize, and I would like to express here
our deep condolences to the people of Taiwan for the tragic
consequences of the earthquake that struck recently. It is
our hope that the United Nations will be able to embrace
the Republic of China on Taiwan in the family of nations,
as part of a peaceful and just solution to the China
question, one that respects the aspirations and rights of all
Chinese people.","Belize joins others in support of the Middle East
peace process. We continue to support the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination. Likewise, we
call upon this Organization to recognize the desire of
the 23 million people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan for the opportunity to contribute and participate
in the work of this Organization and other international
bodies.","If we are to speak of shared responsibility for
development and the maintenance of peace and
security, this year especially we must ensure that
everyone be allowed to participate in this global forum.
In this light, we continue to appeal to this Organization
to consider the right of the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan and allow their voices to
be heard in this world institution. Equally, we must
continue to advocate recognition of the Palestinian
people’s right to self-determination, including the right
to their independent State.","It is our wish that the United Nations be the
forum for the representation of all peoples of the world,
including the 23 million people of the Republic of
China on Taiwan. We must give true meaning to the
principle of universality set forth in the Charter and,
more specifically, to the affirmation therein of our faith
in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth
of the human person, in the equal rights of men and
women and of nations large and small.","And speaking of all, we need to respect the
principle of universality of our Organization. The time
has come to admit Taiwan to membership of the United
Nations. Taiwan has proven itself to be an exemplary
member of the international community with a deep
sense of solidarity with small and poor nations.","For that reason, we shall remain strong
proponents of the right of the Palestinian people to a
secure and viable State. It is also for the same reason
that we support the Taiwanese people’s right for
representation before the United Nations.","The 23 million people on Taiwan also deserve to
live in peace and security. We therefore continue to
urge the United Nations to take up the plea of Taiwan
to participate in this world body. Taiwan has earned its
place among the community of nations.","Membership in the United Nations is an
affirmation of the will of sovereign peoples. The
United Nations has served as a platform for the
expression of that will for many of the nations
represented here today. Let us in turn ensure that the
United Nations remains a beacon of hope for all
peoples who continue the struggle, such as our brothers
and sisters in Palestine, Western Sahara, Taiwan and
the non-self governing territories. ","It is in this spirit of respect for law and justice
and of the desire for equity and for the preservation of
human rights that we continue to struggle with the
decision of this body to exclude any true debate over
the inclusion of the right of the 23 million people of
Taiwan to representation in this institution. The desire
of the people of Taiwan is not only to take part in the
deliberations of this institution but, indeed, to be
engaged on the critical issues facing the international
community. We remain steadfast in our support for
their aspirations and will continue to advocate for their
representation, as well as that of the Saharawi people,
who lack a voice in our United Nations. ","To that end, the United Nations must be
strengthened so as better to serve to monitor the
implementation of the globally agreed commitments.
Its universality must be reinforced with the
participation of all relevant stakeholders in its elaboration of responses to our threats and challenges.
In that regard, my Government wholeheartedly
supports the participation of the Republic of China on
Taiwan in the United Nations specialized agencies.
Finally, its decisions must carry the full weight that
impels action. ","Building upon the momentum of the muchproclaimed new era of engagement, we are hopeful that
longstanding issues on the international peace and
security agenda may achieve progress. In some cases,
change is already afoot. Cross-Strait relations between
Taiwan and China have improved and, for the first
time, Taiwan has participated as an observer at the
World Health Assembly. Haiti held elections earlier this year, in a relatively peaceful and orderly fashion.
After 47 years, the Organization of American States
has now lifted Cuba’s suspension from that body. ","While Belize’s traditional donors have long
provided valuable assistance, for which we will always
be grateful, we are now benefiting from new modalities
of cooperation, which are yielding more direct and
immediate returns for our people. Belize’s cooperation
experience with Taiwan exemplifies a model of
cooperation based on partnership. With the help of the
Government of Taiwan, Belize has steadily developed
its capacity in agricultural research, aquaculture,
education and social-sector investment. ","Belize is of the view that, given the quantum and
scale of the problems which confront the world today
and the unquestioned need for an ever-increasing
amount of resources, the international community
cannot afford not to avail itself of every source of
assistance at hand. And in that regard, we wish to urge
that the Republic of China, Taiwan, be allowed to
participate meaningfully in the work of the United
Nations. In a similar vein, we would urge that the
embargo against Cuba, which the Assembly has
denounced for many years, be brought to a speedy end. ","Belize also notes and joins those positive voices
that support Taiwan. We therefore urge Taiwan’s full
participation in the United Nations.","Earlier I referred to my country’s position on the
post-2015 development agenda — that the agenda
must be inclusive if we are to achieve meaningful
development. We need to ensure that all our countries
are allowed to participate in a meaningful manner,
and that includes the people of the Republic of China
on Taiwan. We cannot deny the significant advances
they have been able to make in such a short time, or
their contributions in support of global goals and
commitments, especially in the area of development
cooperation. Their experience can teach us about
advancing our own development.","Belize endorses without reservation the call for
the Republic of Taiwan to be permitted to participate
in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. In
this modern day and age, it is incomprehensible that
we should want to deny ourselves the benefit of their
expertise in dealing with global issues.","Belize supports the ongoing initiatives to reform
the United Nations to make it more representative and
better able to maintain peace and resolve conflicts.
We continue to call for the United Nations to engage
with Taiwan, whose 23 million people stand ready
to contribute, especially through United Nations
specialized agencies, to resolving the world’s problems
and who have every expectation that their interests
should be heard and represented.","In that spirit of inclusiveness, Belize urges
that the Republic of China on Taiwan be accorded
meaningful participation in the work of the United
Nations. The Taiwanese Government has been working
assiduously to promote international cooperation and
development, in line with the spirit and principles of
the Millennium Development Goals. It has also fully
embraced the Sustainable Development Goals. We
urge the international community to welcome Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in the mechanisms, meetings
and activities of the United Nations specialized
agencies, including the World Health Organization, the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.","For Belize, as a State Member of the United
Nations, advocating for peaceful cooperation among
States, the right to self-determination for all peoples
and the promotion and protection of human rights is
a non-derogable duty. We therefore cannot remain
silent wherever injustice persists. We see injustice
perpetrated against the people of Taiwan, who uphold
the core purposes and principles of the United Nations,
while, in contrast, the United Nations fails to uphold
those purposes and principles with respect to them.","In a similar spirit of determination, Belize reiterates
its plea on behalf of the 23 million people of Taiwan for
a new approach to Taiwan’s participation in the United
Nations system. Taiwan is the twenty-second-largest
economy in the world. It is a vibrant democracy that
has fully embraced international norms and standards.
Yet, despite global recognition of its successes and the
readiness of States Members of the United Nations
to conduct business with this fast-growing economy,
the Organization has cut them off. It has gone so far
as to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Taiwanese
passports, thereby even preventing Taiwanese tourists
from entering its premises as visitors. It effectively
uses resolution 2758 (XXXVI), of 1971, as a political
and humanitarian embargo on Taiwan. In our view, no
such embargo has any place in the United Nations.","Symptomatic of those injustices is the exclusion
of Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, from
representation in the United Nations. In our view, it is
a travesty of justice for this institution to rely doggedly
and erroneously on resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted
in 1971, to block Taiwan’s participation in any of its
bodies. Belize calls upon the United Nations to end
what is effectively a political and humanitarian embargo
against the people of Taiwan.","This right to self determination is also applicable to the people of the Republic
of China (Taiwan) and their continued exclusion from the UN and its institutions
is contrary to the goals of the organisation. Belize calls for the full participation
of Taiwan in the UN system. It is manifest that they possess the capacity so to do
as exemplified in their successful and effective approach to COVID-19 and their
outreach to allied and other countries."
Burkina Faso,,,,,"The first democratic elections have taken place in
South Africa. The South African people now have
leaders that they have freely elected. We once again hail
the eminence of President Mandela, as well as the merits
of Vice-President De Klerk, for having been able,
together with the people of South Africa, to lead South
Africa towards a democratic and non-racial society. Here
among us at last in the United Nations, South Africa will
be able to play and fully shoulder its role in the
community of nations, thus strengthening that principle of
universality that we supported in a recent initiative
concerning the Republic of China.","In Asia, Burkina Faso welcomes the spirit of dialogue
and cooperation that prevails between the two Koreas and
between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and
the United States of America. We would note, however,
that a country like the Republic of China in Taiwan has not
been able to be among us again this year, at a time when
we are to celebrate a historic event.","Turning to the subject of Taiwan, Burkina Faso
would refer to the principle of universality in the matter
of representation of 22 million people. We hope that an
ad hoc committee will be established.","Burkina Faso, together with other Member States, has
asked for consideration of the need to review resolution
2758 (XXVI), which excludes from the United Nations the
Republic of China on Taiwan. In doing so, Burkina Faso
has no intention of violating the rights of another Member
State. It merely asks that, given the new context, the reality
of the Republic of China be acknowledged. This reality is
demonstrated by the many and various relations that the
Republic of China has in one form or another with most
States. A review would do justice to the 21.5 million
inhabitants while work goes on to resolve the matter by the
reunification desired by both sides.","In the same vein, can the United Nations continue to
deny the legal and international reality of a State such as
the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose 22 million women
and men are excluded from making any contribution to the
activities of our Organization?","In this context, the issue of the Republic of China on
Taiwan also deserves attention. In the interests of equity
and of the principle of universality, Burkina Faso believes that it is unfair virtually to ostracize 22 million Chinese
people. That is why we firmly support the initiative to
create a study group to examine the particular and
exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan
so as to determine how that entity could be represented in
the United Nations.","With regard to the United Nations, we are
convinced that making it more democratic is absolutely
necessary. That democratization must include a
thorough reform of the decision-making processes of
the system, and of the Security Council in particular,
and should go hand in hand with giving greater
attention to development issues, particularly through a
more thorough examination of the idea of a
development council, as proposed by the Millennium
Summit. It also means making the Organization truly
universal. In this regard, Burkina Faso welcomes the
admission of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. We
also think it is unfair to continue to marginalize the
Republic of China, a country that meets all the
requirements of a sovereign State to take its place in
the United Nations.","The Republic of China in Taiwan, which has
demonstrated sufficiently that it is a democratic and
peaceful State, is prepared to play its rightful role in
the concert of nations, and it should no longer suffer
from the injustice that we are combating each day. That
is why, in the name of equality among peoples and
nations, we make an urgent appeal for the readmission
of the Republic of China to the United Nations.","The recent admission of Switzerland to the
United Nations and the forthcoming admission of
Timor-Leste further confirm the irreplaceable role of
the United Nations as an means of ensuring
international stability. It is precisely because of that
universality that Burkina Faso is able to call upon the
international community to consider the return of the
Republic of China to this world Organization. Taiwan
has clearly shown that it is a free, independent,
democratic nation that enjoys all the attributes of a
State under international law and that would thus be
able to make a truly useful contribution to the building
of a better future for humankind. The credibility of the
United Nations is at stake in this respect.","Thus, the long-sought reform of the United
Nations, with the democratization of the institution, its
structures and operations, the main goal, is becoming
an imperative. It must give greater and better
responsibilities to all nations, small and large, and
avoid exclusion, such as those that have been against
the Republic of China on Taiwan for 30 years. Nothing
justifies keeping that country of 23 million inhabitants
sidelined at the United Nations.","Within the new United Nations that we so
sincerely desire, the situation of the Republic of China
on Taiwan will finally be resolved fairly and
acceptably. Reason dictates that that country, which
cooperates with a large part of the international
community and makes a valuable contribution to
universal civilization, should be rapidly integrated into
the United Nations.","I hardly need recall that the current session’s
leitmotif is the democratization of the United Nations.
It is therefore rather difficult to understand how we can
continue to disregard the rights of 23 million
Taiwanese people. The time has come to deal justly
with that people, which for decades now has
demonstrated its commitment to democracy, peace and
international solidarity.","That spirit of openness and universalization in the
Organization must be a component of a genuine and
irreversible democratic movement. That is why we
must do justice by the 23 million Taiwanese whose
only aspiration has always been to play an active role
in our common endeavour to build a better world. ","We also deplore the ongoing injustice committed
against the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose
legitimate aspiration to participate fully in world
affairs has been denied. Nevertheless, that country is a
good example of successful democracy and social and
economic development. By depriving 25 million men
and women of the right to make their contribution to
the realization of United Nations principles and
objectives, our Organization is also depriving itself of
its own quest for modernity and universality.
Therefore, it is a new United Nations, open to all, that
Burkina Faso earnestly calls for.
 Burkina Faso reaffirms its faith in multilateralism
and in the role of the United Nations as an
irreplaceable instrument for peace, development and
the promotion of dialogue among peoples, which it is
our historic duty to preserve and strengthen. ","I note with pleasure an improvement in relations
between the Republic of China or Taiwan and the
People’s Republic of China. I deeply hope that this
new spirit will open the way to Taiwan’s participation
in the activities of international organizations. ","The contribution of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to assisting the least developed countries
should be commended, and its participation in the
previous session of the World Health Assembly augurs
well for the positive evolution of this country’s
contribution to the life of the international community. ","We trust that this reform dynamic will promote a
new spirit that will open the way to participation by the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of
international bodies, particularly the International Civil
Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. ","Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism, in
solidarity among peoples and in the virtue of dialogue
among nations. My delegation notes with great
satisfaction the peaceful climate that currently prevails
in the relationship between the Republic of China on
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That will
favour the granting to the Republic of China on Taiwan
the place that it deserves in the concert of nations,
including its genuine participation in the activities of
international organizations such as the International
Civil Aviation Organization and conferences such as
those on the United Nations Climate Change
Convention. ","Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism, solidarity
between peoples and the virtue of dialogue among
nations. In that regard, my delegation notes with great
satisfaction the calm atmosphere that currently prevails
in the relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan)
and the People’s Republic of China. That would
argue in favour of granting the Republic of China its
rightful place among the family of nations, including
through its meaningful participation in the activities
of international organizations such as the International
Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.","The climate of dialogue and détente that
characterizes relations between the Republic of China
on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China should
be welcomed and encouraged. In that spirit, we must
welcome the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
United Nations specialized agencies, particularly the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
We also welcome Taiwan’s incalculable contribution
in support of the achievement by developing countries
such as Burkina Faso of the Millennium Development
Goals.","Burkina Faso reaffirms its commitment to the
ideals of the United Nations based on the principles of
peaceful coexistence, dialogue and peaceful settlement
of disputes. It is with conviction that we welcome and
strongly encourage the rapprochement of views between
the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of
China on Taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis
for such an approach. We favour the wider participation
of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized
agencies of the United Nations. We salute the spirit of understanding displayed by
the international community in allowing the involvement
of that country in international organizations in order to
enable it to play a broader role on the world stage through
its contribution to the achievement of development goals, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso.
Readmitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to our
Organization is worth considering. With 23 million
inhabitants and a large economy, the Republic of China
on Taiwan has established itself as a key player in the
international arena in terms of promoting peace and
contributing to development efforts. ","Always respectful of the ideals of the United
Nations, which are based on the principles of peaceful
coexistence, dialogue and the peaceful resolution of
disputes, we welcome and encourage a rapprochement between the People’s Republic of China and the
Republic of China on Taiwan.",,"Multilateralism is the tool par excellence of
dialogue and solidarity among peoples. In that regard,
the international community would certainly benefit
from the Republic of China on Taiwan’s effective and
broader participation in the specialized agencies and
mechanisms of the United Nations system. In the name
of that same dialogue and solidarity, which characterize
peaceful relations among the actors on the international
stage, Burkina Faso is in favour of the total lifting of
the embargo on Cuba so that Havana and Washington,
D.C., can maintain mutually beneficial partnership
relations.",,,
Central African Republic,,,,"For this reason, in the view of the delegation of the
Central African Republic, today it is important that the place
of the Republic of China in our Organization bereconsidered. The immense progress made by the Republic
of China in Taiwan in the political, economic and social
spheres has now earned it the right to resume its place here
so that it can contribute, better than it did in the past, to the
flourishing of international cooperation through its active
participation in the United Nations system.","In the past, it was discrimination between the East
and West blocs, whose consequences, in the form of the
cold war, plunged a large part of mankind into a
catastrophic situation. In the past, it was discrimination
between the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization. In the past, it was racial discrimination in
South Africa. Today, we still see discrimination:
between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic
of China in Taiwan.
And yet, the Berlin Wall has fallen, as did the walls
of Jericho in days gone by, marking the end of the EastWest bloc system. The conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians has yielded to coexistence between the State
of Israel and the State of Palestine. The criminal
foundations of apartheid have crumbled and given way to
a new, democratic South Africa with a human face. Why not today help the two Chinas to overcome their
temporary divergences, which arise out of past history, in
order that China might be reconciled with itself in the
higher interests of the Chinese people and of the peoples
that are friends of the two Chinas? Why exclude the
Republic of China in Taiwan from the great family of the
international community? Why reject a State that has
21 million inhabitants? Where is our respect for them?
Why encourage the conflict between the Chinas, when we
know that the two exchange technologies and complement
each other?
For my part, and on behalf of the Central African
Republic, I reaffirm that we intend to maintain diplomatic,
economic, cultural and social relations with the two Chinese
States without restriction. The choice resides solely with
the People’s Republic of China or the Republic of China in
Taiwan....That is why my country, a co-sponsor of the draft
resolution on the “Consideration of the exceptional situation
of the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international
context, based on the principle of universality and in
accordance with the established model of parallel
representation of divided countries at the United Nations”,
deeply regrets that this item was not placed on the agenda
of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The
race towards the great market of the People’s Republic of
China should not obscure the problems of discrimination
that exist between the Chinese peoples. I am still
convinced that patience and wisdom will prevail one day,
as they have recently in many of the countries we
mentioned earlier.","Finally, with regard to the advancement of democracy,
the efforts of the United Nations will never be sufficient so
long as the Republic of China on Taiwan is not admitted as
a Member of this prestigious institution.
As His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé, President
of the Central African Republic, noted in his appeal last
year, under the Charter of the United Nations there are no
large nations and there are no small nations, for all must
contribute to peace and universal progress towards a just,
humane and democratic world.
Democracy and respect for fundamental human rights
have and will have no meaning so long as the hard-working
population of the Republic of China on Taiwan is not
represented here in the Assembly. In this connection it
would be fitting to take into account the precedents that
exist with regard to the parallel representation of States in
the United Nations. The Government of the Central African Republic
also believes that dedication to international peace and
security should prohibit our engaging in any form of
intimidation or confrontation that can damage
rapprochement among States or, especially, weaken
security. This requires the highly desirable admission of
the Republic of China to the United Nations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chad,,,,,,,,"My country has noted with satisfaction the end of
the bipolar world, which has made possible the advent of
a new type of constructive dialogue that will enable us
together to meet the challenges of the twenty-first
century. In resuming diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China, the Government and people of Chad have no intention other than to diversify their relations of
friendship and cooperation with all peace- and justiceloving countries of the world on the basis of equality and
solidarity. In the name of the principle of universality so
dear to our Organization, we support the return of the
Republic of China to the concert of nations.","My country, Chad, noted with satisfaction the end of
the bipolar world and the radical change that took place in
the international situation. By resuming diplomatic relations
with the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Government and
the people of Chad had only one consideration: to diversify
relations of friendship with cooperation with all the peaceand justice-loving countries of the world on the basis of
equality and solidarity. Thus Chad gave its support to the
request that an examination of General Assembly resolution
2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 be inscribed on the
agenda of the fifty-third session, because of the radical
changes in the international situation and the coexistence of
two Governments, one on each side of the Straits of
Taiwan.","In Asia, Chad is concerned about the fate of the
Republic of China on Taiwan and its 22 million
inhabitants. The Republic of China on Taiwan, which
plays a major role in world trade, is a peace-loving
country that fulfils the obligations in the United Nations
Charter, as it has shown on many occasions. Chad
supports the admission of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to the United Nations as a means of correcting an
injustice.","The inter-Korean dialogue might also arouse
some interest on the part of the Taiwan Strait where
tension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high.
Whereas economic and trade relations between the two
countries are being developed on a regular basis, political relations are non-existent, despite the fact that
on both sides of the Strait semi-official structures have
been set up which serve as channels of communication
between the People’s Republic of China and the
Republic of China, Taiwan.
Both parties should show political determination
and imagination in exploring ways and means of
reducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue. In all
events, the international community is duty bound to
reconsider the whole question of admitting the
Republic of China, Taiwan to membership of our
Organization, particularly in light of the weight and the
importance of the economic role it plays internationally
and the fact that it is so closely involved in actions for
development and the reduction of poverty.
For its part, the Government of Chad supports the
request by the Republic of China, Taiwan, to seek
membership in the United Nations and its specialized
agencies.","Turning to another injustice in the world, namely,
the inhuman embargo imposed on Iraq, my
Government calls for its immediate and unconditional
lifting, because it no longer has any justification. As to
the injustice committed by our Organization vis-à-vis
the Republic of China on Taiwan, the time has come to
set things right, in order to allow that country, whose
human, economic and political weight is unquestioned,
to occupy its legitimate place in the family of nations,
which is to say in the United Nations, following its
recent admission to the World Trade Organization,
which we welcome.","Likewise, the Government of the Republic of
Chad cannot remain silent on another situation of
injustice that continues to preoccupy the Organization:
its exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. That
issue comes back to us every year like a boomerang
because we handled it badly more than 30 years ago.
For us, as a result, it is a matter of conscience that
challenges all of us to find a solution. We have stated
on a number of occasions that it is not a question of redressing one injustice by committing another;0 it is
simply a question of giving back to the Republic of
China on Taiwan, a democratic and responsible
sovereign State, and to its people the place they should
have on the international stage. This is why, once
again, the Government of Chad calls for the admission
of The Republic of China on Taiwan to the
Organization.","I cannot conclude without drawing the attention
of the international community to the crucial issue of
the representation of the Republic of China on Taiwan
in our Organization. That country has diplomatic
relations and relations of cooperation with many
Member States, including Chad. Paradoxically,
however, with regard to the United Nations, it finds
itself without any status. Its ostracism is unjustified
and unjustifiable.
Indeed, the Republic of China was one of the
founders of the United Nations and was represented
here from 1949 through 1971. The fact that this item
comes up each and every year in the debates of the
General Assembly proves that a substantive issue is at
stake. Chad deems it inadmissible for 23 million
Taiwanese to be discriminated against by the United
Nations and its specialized agencies. It is thus
unfortunate to note that, in the current context, the
World Health Organization, for example, cannot lend
Taiwan assistance in the event of epidemics, which was
recently the case with severe acute respiratory
syndrome. Yet the Taiwanese also have the right to live
in serenity, to lead a democratic life and to be in
solidarity with the world’s other peoples. They need
peace — the very foundation of democracy and a
condition for development. Peace presupposes the
resolution of conflicts through mediation. That implies,
in both hearts and minds, a culture of tolerance and
respect for differences.
We urge this session to put an end to Taiwan’s
exclusion by restoring its status as a full-fledged
United Nations Member, and we take this opportunity
to invite all States in the region to halt the military
escalation.","Another injustice should be pointed out. I must
draw the Assembly’s attention to the question of the
exclusion from our ranks of a large community of the
23 million men and women of the Republic of China
on Taiwan. Those men and women, who increasingly
are asserting themselves in international trade and are
generating wealth throughout the world, deserve to be
fully associated in decision-making on subjects and in
areas with an impact on their lives and those of all
humankind. The United Nations would have everything
to gain and nothing to lose with their active
participation in debates on the many topics of
international concern. Their contribution would
undoubtedly enrich the Assembly debates and would
help us build the operational capacity of our world
institutions, funds and programmes.","With regard to the disagreement between the
People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, we appreciate
Taiwan’s tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution.
The international community must encourage the two
parties to accept each other. The readmission of Taiwan
into the United Nations, which we believe to be a
legitimate demand of that country, would be the point
of departure for such acceptance.",,"In this regard, I wish to recall the need to respect
the principles of peaceful coexistence, which are
respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity
of States. This, of course, prompts us to reaffirm our
devotion to respect for internationally recognized
historical borders. We cite as an example our
attachment to the policy of a single China and our
opposition to Taiwan’s attempts to bring about a kind
of accession to the United Nations, under whatever
name they might choose. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
China,,,,,,"The Chinese people have waged heroic and unyielding
struggles to resist external aggression and oppression and to
defend the sovereignty, independence and unity of the
country. There is but one China in the world. The
Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole
legal Government of China. It is the sole representative of
China at the United Nations, and Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China. The peaceful reunification of the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits represents the unshakable will and
determination of the entire Chinese people, including our
compatriots in Taiwan. Proceeding from this reality, the
Chinese Government has put forward the correct proposal
on peaceful reunification within the framework of the
concept of “one country, two systems” and a series of
realistic and practicable policies and measures. The past
few years have seen a steady expansion and deepening of
exchanges and contacts between the two sides in various
fields. Any attempt to obstruct peaceful reunification and to
split Taiwan from China is doomed to failure. Should
anyone try to do so, he would be lifting a stone only to
drop it on his own toes.","Twenty-five years ago, at its twenty-sixth session,
the General Assembly adopted the historic resolution
2758 (XXVI), solemnly declaring the restoration to the
People’s Republic of China all its lawful rights in the
United Nations. That resolution thoroughly settled the
question of China’s representation in the United Nation in
all aspects — political, legal and procedural.
There is but one China in the world and Taiwan is
an inalienable part of its sacred territory. “Peaceful
reunification and one country with two systems” — this
is our unswerving guideline for the settlement of the
Taiwan question. This question involves a cardinal
principle of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity
and the great task of reunification. It is a purely internal
affair of China which will brook no outside interference.
The Chinese Government and people are determined to
carry through the struggle against all attempts to split
their territory or create an independent Taiwan. No force
on Earth can hold back China’s great cause of
reunification.","The realization of Deng Xiaoping’s concept of “one
country, two systems” in Hong Kong carries profound
significance. Firmly adhering to this concept, we will
keep up the peaceful reunification of our motherland by
ensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventually
resolving the Taiwan question. Taiwan is an inalienable
part of Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question is
purely an internal affair of China. Any country that
attempts to use the Taiwan question to put pressure on
China or even clamours for “two Chinas” or “one China,
one Taiwan” has acted in total contravention of the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and
the relevant General Assembly resolutions. Such
behaviour will be absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese
people, as well as to all the countries upholding justice in
the world.","Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred
territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the
upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide
useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,
adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and
one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang
Zemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait
relations and promoting the process of peaceful
reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and
resolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of
Taiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and
Taiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.","The Chinese Government and people will, as always,
resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and will continue to advance the great cause of
national reunification. It is a fact universally recognized
by the international community that there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
Chinese territory and that the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
representing the whole of China. China's territory and
sovereignty are absolutely indivisible. The ultimate
reunification of the motherland represents the common
aspiration and firm resolve of all the Chinese people,
including our compatriots on Taiwan. No force can hold us
back in this great cause.
The Chinese Government will continue to adhere to its
established policy for settling the question of Taiwan. We
are firmly opposed to any efforts to create “independence
for Taiwan”, “two Chinas”, or “one China, one Taiwan”.
All moves to divide the motherland are doomed to failure.
China's great cause of national reunification can and will be
accomplished.
A few days ago a powerful earthquake shook China's
province of Taiwan. This earthquake caused heavy loss of
life and property damage for our compatriots in Taiwan.
We are extremely concerned about this catastrophe and
express our sympathy to our compatriots on the island. We
also express our condolences to the families of the victims
of the earthquake. People on both sides of the strait are
brothers and sisters in one big family. The disaster that hit
Taiwan and the pains of our compatriots on the island are
shared by the entire Chinese people. We will provide every
possible support and assistance to alleviate the harm caused
by the earthquake.","To resolve the question of Taiwan once and for all
and complete the reunification of the motherland is a
shared aspiration of the entire Chinese people,
including our Taiwan compatriots. Adherence to the principle of peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems in resolving the Taiwan question will serve the
development of the two sides on either side of the
straits, contribute to amity and unity among
compatriots on both sides, and facilitate peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese
Government and people have committed themselves
more strongly than anyone else to a peaceful
reunification. They have demonstrated the utmost
sincerity and made the greatest efforts to this end. We
are convinced that — with the concerted efforts of the
entire Chinese people, including those living in
Taiwan — China will be able to realize its complete
reunification at an earlier date.",,"There is but one China in the world. Both the
mainland and Taiwan belong to that one China, and
Chinaís sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no
division. The Chinese Government adheres to the basic
policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems; and President Jiang Zeminís eight point
proposal on how to develop ìcross-straitî relations and
promote a peaceful reunification of the motherland for
the current stage. We are firm in our opposition to all
forms of Taiwanese independence activities and will
tolerate no attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest of China in any fashion. All acts of Taiwan independence
are doomed to failure and our grand cause of national
reunification will triumph.",,"Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
Safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity and realizing complete national reunification
at an early date is the common will and firm resolve of
the 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of
“peaceful reunification and one country, two systems”,
the Chinese Government is ready to work tirelessly
towards a peaceful reunification with the utmost
sincerity. We, more than anyone else, want to see a
peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But we
will never tolerate Taiwan independence, nor will we
allow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of China
in any way.
We hope that the international community will
fully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of the
current situation across the Taiwan Strait and the
serious threat posed by the separatist activities of the
Taiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Strait
and the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect the
Assembly to continue supporting the Chinese
Government’s efforts for peaceful reunification and to
join us in containing pro-independence activities, in the
interest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.",,,"Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.
We will not permit any challenge to the one-China
principle and General Assembly resolution 2758
(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General
Assembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related
issues in the agenda of the General Assembly session.
This fully demonstrates that any move that runs
counter to the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General
Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any
support from the United Nations Member States and is
doomed to failure. We hope that the countries
concerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated
by the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong
moves of this kind. The Taiwan authorities are now obstinately
clinging to the separatist course of “Taiwan
independence” and are trying by all means to secure a
referendum on applying for membership of the United
Nations under the name Taiwan. This is another
dangerous step towards “de jure Taiwan independence”
taken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked,
this move will gravely endanger peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Chinese Government has always made every effort
to promote with all sincerity peaceful development of
cross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful
reunification. However, we will never allow anyone to
separate Taiwan from China in name or in any other
way. We hope that the international community will
continue to support China’s cause of peaceful
reunification, support the Chinese people in opposing
and repulsing separatist activities for “Taiwan
independence” and work with us to maintain peace and
stability across the Taiwan Straits and in the AsiaPacific region. ",,,,,"The Diaoyu islands and their affiliated islands
have been an integral part of China’s territory since
ancient times, and China has indisputable historical
and jurisprudential evidence to support that claim.
Japan waged an expansionist war of aggression against
China at the end of the nineteenth century. In the same
way that other colonial countries grabbed and occupied
the land of many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, Japan stole Taiwan and its affiliated islands,
including the Diaoyu islands, from China through that
war and began its colonial rule over them. ",,,,,,,,
Combodia ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With regard to the Taiwan issue, Cambodia is of
the view that it is a vital issue not only for China, but
also for the region as a whole. Cambodia, like other
members of the community of nations, has been
unequivocally supportive of a genuine “one-China”
policy, since we recognize the fact that Taiwan is an
integral part of China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comoros,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our peoples expect much from our Organization,
recognized as offering the best framework to guarantee
the fundamental rights of all. This is why, confident in
the United Nations to ensure the respect for unity and
territorial integrity of our respective countries, the
Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros urges our
Organization to consider the legitimate claim of the
Chinese Government with respect to the reintegration
of the Chinese province of Taiwan in its natural entity.
My country, especially sensitive to this problem, as we
ourselves have had a painful secessionist experience,
believes firmly in the need to find swift solutions to
this type of situation, which could undermine the
stability of regions.",,,"In the same spirit, my country attaches the utmost
importance to the principle of a single independent and
indivisible China and calls for the restoration of the
island of Taiwan to its rightful home.","The situation in Asia also deserves the focused
attention of the international community. The stalemate
in the issue of the Chinese province of Taiwan, to cite
just one instance, is not conducive to the promotion of
stability in that part of the world. That is why, in its
concern for the ongoing prevalence of law in
international relations, and in order to guarantee
respect for the national unity of countries, the Union of
the Comoros urges the General Assembly to heed the
legitimate claims of the Government of the People’s
Republic of China over the Chinese province of
Taiwan.",,"In the ongoing quest for peace and freedom, I
have a particular thought for those who, throughout the
world, are engaged in struggle and are claiming their
rights to unity and territorial integrity. Thus, from this
rostrum, I would like to renew to our friend the
People’s Republic of China, our commitment to a
policy of a single China, single and indivisible. To our
brother country the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like
to reaffirm our support for its legitimate fight to
recover its territorial integrity. ",,"Here, I would also like to reiterate the
unwavering support of the Union of the Comoros to the
People’s Republic of China and to the Kingdom of Morocco in their legitimate efforts to recover their
territorial integrity. ","We also reiterate our unwavering support for the
legitimate demands of the People’s Republic of China

make particular mention of countries that occupy a
special place in Comorians’ hearts. For the Kingdom of
Morocco, a brother country whose legitimate positions
on the Western Sahara my country has always
supported, I hope that the dialogue being held under
the auspices of the United Nations will quickly lead to
a peaceful solution to the problem. To the People’s
Republic of China, that great country and friend to the
Comoros, we here reaffirm our unfailing support for it
in its legitimate struggle for one China, developing in
peace and prosperity. ",,,,,,,,,
Costa Rica,,,"From this
perspective, my country considers it indispensable that the United Nations
should comply fully with the principle of universality and open its doors to
those who, for various reasons, have been forced to remain outside it.
Of special concern to us is the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan,
a democratic community of 21 million people with a brilliant economic
development record whose reality cannot continue to be ignored by an
Organization that takes pride in having gone beyond the patterns of the cold
war. ","My country considers that the United Nations cannot
continue to ignore the question of the Republic of China in
Taiwan. The existence of that exemplary country and the
future of its 21 million inhabitants demand a revision of its
relations with the United Nations. We firmly support the
establishment of an ad hoc committee to study and find
satisfactory solution to that problem in accordance with the
fundamental principles of international law.","We nevertheless hope that this universality will
become total as soon as possible, without any exceptions
whatever. Today, Costa Rica would like to reaffirm its
strong support for the legitimate aspirations of the
Republic of China in Taiwan to take part in the efforts of
the United Nations. We believe that the people of that
nation must be represented in this family of nations. It is
a reality, and it is also an issue that the Organization
cannot continue to sidestep.",,"In the same line of action, Central America has set
out on a quest for innovative approaches to the rest of the
world that will help it realize its political, social,
economic, cultural and environmental goals. This joint
fraternal action aimed at reincorporating Central America
into the international community has sought to
institutionalize new links with other countries and regions
that have supported our efforts to attain peace and
democracy in the isthmus, and that are now cooperating
in our struggle for sustainable development. Central
America has thus established special mechanisms of
dialogue and cooperation with Mexico, Chile, Canada, the
United States of America, Japan, the Republic of Korea
and the Republic of China on Taiwan. We have also
redefined our relations with the European Union,
institutionalized since the start of the last decade in what
is known as the San José dialogue. We hope that in the
near future these activities will be extended to other
countries and regions.",,,"I would like to express my condolences to the
people of the Republic of China on Taiwan for the tragic
earthquake that devastated its territory on Monday, 20
September, and the recent after-shock. My most heartfelt
sympathy goes to the families of the victims and the
injured.
Costa Rica has a firm relationship with the Republic
of China on Taiwan. We admire its shared economic
progress, its respect for human rights and its democracy,
much promoted by President Lee. Our deep commitment
to the cause of peace prompts us to view with concern the
growing differences and instability in the region during
the last year. We fear that these threaten peace and might
unleash a new armaments race. For this reason, we trust
that the differences will be resolved through constructive dialogue and negotiation in good faith, with respect for the
interests of the whole Chinese people.","Our experience has taught us that only democracy
can provide the necessary framework for the full
respect of human rights. Only democracy which grants
all citizens equal rights and opportunities to participate
in the political process can secure true peace. Only a
democratic system which bestows on all people equal
opportunities to enjoy the benefits of economic
development and personal accomplishment will make
possible sustainable and just development. For that
reason, we celebrate the democratic consolidation that,
thanks to recent elections after a long period under the
same ruling party, is being enjoyed by Mexico and by
the Republic of China in Taiwan — which deserves an
appropriate place in international forums.","In this context, I would like to mention the
bilateral assistance that the Republic of China in Taiwan has given our region to face these emergencies.
Costa Rica understands and supports the repeated
efforts of the Republic of China in Taiwan, with 23
million inhabitants and a firm process of democratic
development and strengthening, to obtain
representation within this Organization. That country
also constitutes one of the main industrial centres of
the Asian basin, with which most Member States have
strong commercial and technical exchange ties. We
hope that all differences will soon be put aside so that
it will be possible to achieve agreements and both
branches of the Chinese people will be able to
participate jointly in international forums.","My country would like to see greater tolerance
prevail in the Taiwan Straits. We hope to see a just
settlement that would fulfil the desires of the entire
Chinese people. Costa Rica has historically enjoyed
and continues to enjoy close friendly relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan. Creative agreements
have been reached in many international organizations
to permit the participation of the Republic of China in
their work. The world would be a far more peaceful
place if we were able to find an innovative accord to
allow that country and its people to be represented with
dignity in this and other international organizations.","In 1971, the General Assembly approved the
entry of the Peopleís Republic of China into the United
Nations. That decision was correct, inasmuch as it
promoted the universal character of this global
Organization. In accordance with that same principle,
my country has since that time been advocating that the
Republic of China on Taiwan also be represented in
this Organization.
We believe that the Republic of China on Taiwan
could greatly contribute to the work of this
Organization. For many years that nation was an active
Member of the United Nations. It participated
constructively in all of its activities and the work of its
bodies. Since then, the Republic of China on Taiwan
has been developing close and productive relations
with peoples and Governments throughout the world,
promoting programmes and projects for the sustainable
development of communities. In keeping with the
principle of universality that the United Nations itself
promotes, Costa Rica advocates that both Governments
be represented at this Organization.","The maintenance of prerogatives for some States,
to the detriment of the great majority of States
Members, is not only antidemocratic, but contrary to
the principle of sovereign equality among States
enshrined in the San Francisco Charter itself.
Committed to the principles of universality and
democracy on which the United Nations is based, I
renew Costa Rica’s longstanding call for the admission
to the United Nations, in conditions of full legal
equality, of the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose
Government has often reiterated its willingness to
assume the obligations imposed by the Charter.","We believe that the General Assembly should
seriously consider the question of the representation of
the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United
Nations. There is no doubt that the Republic of China
on Taiwan could contribute to the work of the
Organization. Incorporating the Republic of China on
Taiwan into the community of nations is also necessary
so that it may fully assume the rights and duties that arise from the various legal regimes of global
governance in areas as varied as collective security,
development assistance, the fight against terrorism,
sustainable development and the various international
health mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Czech Republic,,,,,,,,,,"Let me now touch briefly on one more serious
problem. Recent earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and Taiwan
have underlined the need for the world to be prepared to
provide coordinated help to an area hit by a massive natural
disaster. This experience should, in our view, lead to the
further strengthening and deepening of the idea already
presented some time ago, namely, the idea of the “White
Helmets”. The challenge is to extend “White Helmets“ into
regular international rescue forces under United Nations
leadership, capable of coordinated action on the spot —
naturally, with the consent of the countries receiving such
assistance. The ultimate goal could be the formation of rapidresponse international forces, formed of national
contingents and permanently available, well-equipped expert
groups which could be dispatched to the stricken area in a
matter of minutes or hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dominica,,,,"The universality of membership is an important
principle of the United Nations. We believe that, in keeping
with this principle and in accordance with the established
pattern of parallel representation of divided countries in the
United Nations, the exceptional case of the Republic of
China on Taiwan should be seriously considered by the
international community at the next session of the General
Assembly. The Republic of China on Taiwan, with its rich
natural and human resources could, if given the opportunity,
make a significant contribution to the international
community. Its people are also entitled to enjoy the rights
enjoyed by all populations of the Members of this world
body. The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore supports
the efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan to obtain full
membership of the United Nations after being unable to
participate for 22 years.","The exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan
from membership in this body and from participation in the
activities of its various agencies continues to be of concern
to us. It appears incongruous to us that an industrial
country of 21 million people with a democratic
Government, with full membership in the Asian
Development Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Forum, the Pacific Basin Economic Council and the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council, and with the capacity to
make meaningful and worthwhile contributions to the
activities of the United Nations is denied membership when everyone agrees that it exercises sovereign authority over
a defined geographical area. On the principle of
universality alone, the request of the Republic of China
on Taiwan for membership in the United Nations is
justifiable. We do not believe that the admission of the
Republic of China on Taiwan precludes eventual
unification. On the contrary, in our view it is likely to
help the process along, and no one can pretend that
parallel representation stands in the way. The citizens of
the Republic of China on Taiwan deserve to be accorded
those rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens of all
sovereign States, and the commonwealth of Dominica
advocates and supports the admission of the Republic of
China on Taiwan to full membership in the United
Nations.",,,"It is against this background that the Government and
people of the Commonwealth of Dominica call again on
this world body not to continually close its ears to the pleas
of the Republic of China for international recognition. It
must be remembered that the Republic of China is a
founding Member of this Organization and has been a
Member for the greater part of its existence. The Republic
of China on Taiwan is a politically democratic and
economically dynamic society with a directly elected
Government and Parliament. Dominica therefore urges
Member States not to continue to ignore or block the
efforts being made to admit the Republic of China to
membership of this and other international bodies.","I respectfully submit that in all our deliberations and
actions, as indeed in every aspect of human endeavour,
the aspirations and legitimate expectations of the people
must be central. The 21.5 million people of the Republic
of China on Taiwan aspire to be represented in this body.
They have a legitimate expectation that their country, a
founding Member of the United Nations, should have its
membership restored. We cannot but lend them our
support. Ours must be a policy of inclusion.","The Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to address
once again the issue of legitimate representation for the
Republic of China on Taiwan and its people in the United
Nations. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a model of
democracy in the Asian region, is able and willing to carry
out the obligations contained in the Charter of the United
Nations. Over the past few decades, the Republic of China
has made tremendous strides in economic development,
thus enabling it to make a contribution to poverty
alleviation through economic assistance programmes in
developing countries. Dominica is concerned that an
industrialized country, with a democratically elected
Government, that exercises sovereign authority over a
defined geographical area with a population of 22 million
people, is denied membership of the United Nations. This
situation must be addressed in order to ensure that the
citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan have a
representative voice in the United Nations and its related
agencies.","As the United Nations meets for the first General
Assembly of the new century, the delegation of the
Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to address once
again the issue of democratic representation in the
United Nations for the people of the Republic of China.
It is a concern to my delegation that the Republic of
China, with a democratically elected Government and a
population of 23 million, is unable to participate in our
deliberations.
The Republic of China is a model of democracy
in Asia and is more than able to carry out the
obligations of our Charter. Over the past few decades,
the Republic of China has proved itself to be a good
world citizen, using its own economic development to
generously assist in alleviating debilitating poverty
through economic assistance programmes in many
needy developing countries. The situation of the
Republic of China should be addressed to ensure
participation in the work and activities of our
organization and its agencies as a valued member of
the international community.","The exclusion of the Republic of China on
Taiwan from membership of the United Nations makes
little sense in today’s world of globalization and
interdependence, particularly in light of the fact that
this sovereign State, with a democratically elected
Government, is the world’s seventeenth largest
economy, the fifteenth largest in international trade, the
eighth largest foreign investor, the fourth largest in
terms of foreign exchange reserves, and the third
largest exporter of information technology (IT)
products. The Commonwealth of Dominica intends no
interference in the internal affairs of any Member
State, nor can such interpretation be validly applied to
our action. Our plea is a simple call for justice for the
23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan
and an appeal for the recognition of their right to be
treated in international affairs no differently from
citizens of any other country.","At this time, my Government wishes to place on
record its appreciation of the continued commitment of
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the social,
economic and infrastructural development of small,
vulnerable economies very much like its own. As the
fourteenth largest economy in the world, the Republic
of China on Taiwan has demonstrated the benefits of
having a global perspective on development. We
welcomed the decision of the World Trade
Organization, in November 2001, to admit the Republic
of China on Taiwan as a full member of that
organization. We look forward to a similar occasion
when the Republic of China on Taiwan will take its
place in these halls as a full member of the United
Nations family.","The delegation of the Commonwealth of
Dominica wishes once again to address the
participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
work of the United Nations.
Taiwan has demonstrated its willingness to
provide much needed assistance to countries around the
world, including relief to war-torn and devastated
countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Article 4 of the
United Nations Charter invites all other peace-loving
States to join the Organization and compels us to consider
the participation of Taiwanís 23 million people.
The problem of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) ably demonstrated that progress
towards the noble goals of the United Nations is only
impeded by not integrating the Republic of China on
Taiwan into international efforts to confront global
challenges. The situation regarding the Republic of
China must be addressed to ensure a more meaningful
contribution to global peace, security and poverty
eradication.","Consistent with the overriding principle of
pursuing universal consensus and our own national
development goals, Dominica chose on 24 March 2004
to act in conformity with General Assembly resolution
2758 (XXVI) of 1971 by establishing diplomatic
relations with the People’s Republic of China, thereby
honouring the one-China policy.
Dominica lauds the hand of friendship extended
and the demonstrated commitment of the People’s

countries, which are hard-pressed to fulfil their social and
economic agendas in the light of the adverse impact of
the evolving new world order on their economies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We support the One China policy and call for dialogue

Dominican Republic,,,,"The Dominican delegation believes that, because of the increase in the membership of the United Nations - currently at 184 countries - there should be a more equitable representation in the Security Council, while at the same time we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 23 of the United Nations Charter. Now that the bipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuse of the veto are fading, the Council should become more representative of the new international reality. This should be done in broad consultations, after due reflection and with account taken of the need for equity, so that the Council can become more representative without its effectiveness being in any way mitigated or weakened. Rather, its authority and responsibility will be enhanced so that it can respond effectively to any crisis with which the international community might be confronted, as the Council has done recently. In this regard, we consider that it would be practical and feasible to give the Council greater flexibility in meeting the just aspirations of nations, such as the Republic of China, that wish to become Members of the United Nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles.",,"For that reason, we cannot, as a small nation that
believes in unity within diversity, fail to mention our
support for the agenda item — proposed by Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Dominica, Grenada, Guatemala, GuineaBissau, the Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama,
the Central American Republic, Saint Lucia, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland and our country,
the Dominican Republic — regarding the special situation
of the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international
context, based on the principle of universality and in
accordance with the established model of parallel
representation of divided countries in the United Nations.
The Republic of China on Taiwan, a Founding
Member of the United Nations, has a population of
21 million, a high level of economic development and full
political democracy. It has been a model to all developing
nations. Its aspiration to participate in the United Nations
once again is something positive for the international
community. The Organization must not ignore its
existence. The Dominican Republic supports the
establishment of an ad hoc committee to seek a
satisfactory resolution of this matter.","In expressing its willingness to play a more active
role in the international system, the Dominican Republic
also expresses its concern at the many unresolved
conflicts in different parts of the world. We advocate a
definitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Bosnia
and Herzegovina; of the search for peace in Middle East
between the Government of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization; of cooperation and assistance
with regard to situations such as those of Somalia,
Burundi and Liberia. As to the Republic of China on
Taiwan, we believe that due to its location in the centre
of East Asia, its security and stability bear a close relation
with the peace and prosperity of that region, and we
therefore encourage both the sides along the Taiwan Strait
to resume constructive dialogue with a view to achieving
mutual cooperation and understanding. We believe that
the parallel participation of both sides in the United
Nations would be conducive to maintaining peace.","With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan, the
Dominican Republic reiterates its position as presented by
our President, Dr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna, regarding the need for the international community to consider the
importance of that country, owing to its geographical
location and given the fact that security and stability are
of great significance for the peace and prosperity of the
region. We call for a constructive dialogue between the
two sides of the Strait of Taiwan in search of mutual
understanding and cooperation. We reiterate that parallel
participation of both countries in the United Nations
would contribute to the maintenance of peace.","The crisis spots that afflict large segments of the
world’s population continue to be of concern to many
States. We emphasize the need to strengthen mechanisms
of dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as the
Balkans, the Middle East and the Great Lakes region in
Africa. With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan,
the Dominican Republic reiterates the positions presented
by its President, Mr. Leonel Fernández, with regard to the
need for the international community to consider the
importance of that country, due to its geographic location,
for the peace, security and prosperity of that region. We
favour constructive dialogue between both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to bring about understanding and mutual
cooperation. We reiterate that the parallel participation of
both countries in the United Nations would be conducive to
the maintenance of peace.",,"Because of the desire of the Dominican Republic
to be consistent with the historic tradition of its
international relations, it wishes to reaffirm its support
for the Republic of China in its logical and just
aspiration to rejoin the Organization, of which it was a
prominent Member for many years. Here, our position
reflects a duty born of conscience, not a position that
would diminish the rights that the United Nations has
recognized others to have.","Moreover, we set for ourselves the purpose of
spurring forward reform of the United Nations Charter
and respecting the equality of the rights of nations.
Ratifying the Millennium Declaration means that there
can be no delay in turning the Security Council into a
body that would respond to the historic realities of the
present world and in establishing a logical set of
democratic balances based on those realities. It seems
to us fair for the non-permanent members to participate
in the Security Council via a rotational system that
would give to all the same opportunity. By the same
token, the Dominican Republic believes that it is also a
matter of equity and historical realism for us to accept
the Republic of China on Taiwan as a Member of the
United Nations. Geopolitical reasons must not override
situations of fact that have been recognized in bringing
other States into the United Nations.",,"Although we are aware that this issue has been
excluded from the agenda of the current session , we
wish to state our support for the aspirations of the
Republic of China, Taiwan, to rejoin this Organization,
of which it was a Member for many years. Our position
is in line with the universal principles contained in the
Charter, the basis of the rules of international law and
the historical tradition of friendly relations with
Taiwan.","Finally, the Dominican Republic reiterates its
position, expressed in various forums, on the need for a
constructive dialogue between the nations located on
both sides of the Straits of Taiwan in order to ensure
peace and security in that region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Egypt,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My delegation approves the report presented by
the Bureau for the organization of the work of the
General Assembly. I would like to express the
following in relation to our participation in the work of
the Bureau. The delegation of Egypt was unable to
participate in the discussions last week when the
General Committee examined point 169 on the agenda
relating to the representation of the Republic of China
on Taiwan in the United Nations. Our absence from the
discussion was due to our participation in the general
debate of the General Assembly and in a number of
ministerial meetings that were held at the same time as
the general debate. My delegation would like to affirm before
paragraph 75 is adopted that the Republic of Egypt
affirms and supports the fact that the Government of
People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate
representative of the people of China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
El Salvador,,,,,,,"In recent years, 25 new States have exercised their
sovereign right to self-determination and become Members
of the United Nations, thereby reaffirming the
Organization’s principle of universality. Unfortunately this
principle has not been fully respected and will not be fully
respected until all States, including the Republic of China
in Taiwan, are represented in the United Nations.","The United Nations was created to be universal in
nature. Therefore all peace-loving States that accept the
obligations enshrined in the Charter should be Members of it. For this reason, we reaffirm our support for the just
aspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to rejoin
the Organization on the basis of the principle of
universality, which is the distinguishing mark of the
United Nations.","El Salvador reaffirms its support for the restoration
of the rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan as a
State Member of this Organization because we believe it
is a matter of justice to respect the sovereign will and
aspirations of its people in accordance with the principle
of universality enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations.","In the name of the freedom I have so often evoked, let
me speak of a matter that has been a concern of the
General Assembly: that of the Republic of China on
Taiwan. We believe that when a people, expressing its
sovereign will through democratic elections, elects officials,
chooses a common destiny and builds a vision of its
relations with the rest of the world, it is has the absolute
right to participate on an equal footing with the rest of us
in this forum. For nearly 50 years, we Salvadorans have
maintained relations of all kinds with the Republic of China
on Taiwan. It is our firm hope that that friendly people will
be able to have a voice in this forum.","May I refer to the special case which has been
discussed in the Assembly each of the last eight years
regarding the need to examine the exceptional
international situation of the Republic of China in
Taiwan with a view to guaranteeing full respect for the
fundamental rights of its 23 million inhabitants to
participate in the activities of the United Nations.
We support the establishment of a working group
in the Assembly to examine the appropriate place that
the Republic of China should have in international
bodies. We want to make it quite clear that our support
for this initiative is not intended as an intervention in
the internal affairs of another Member State. Nor does
it represent opposition to the peaceful reunification of
the Chinese people. Rather, it represents the
recognition of the right of a people to realize their just
aspirations, a people which exercises democratic rights
in a country with which we have had excellent relations
for more than 50 years.","The extraordinary situation of the Republic of
China in Taiwan is a case that the international
community should examine, particularly in the light of
the most recent changes in the international system.","We welcome to this important world forum the
Swiss Confederation and, soon, the Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste in their new capacity of
Member States. In this context, we reiterate our request
to review the special international situation of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, whose 23 million
inhabitants are being denied the right to representation
in this forum. We nurture the hope that in the near
future the participation in this world Organization of
all the nations of the world without exclusion — as is
currently the case with Taiwan — will become a
reality.","In conclusion, we wish to express our sorrow at
the death of United Nations staff members in Baghdad.
We reaffirm the right of all nations to have a voice in
this forum. The absence of the Republic of China in the
deliberations of this forum represents a rejection of the
legitimate aspirations of a nation that should speak in
its own voice, just as we do, in this body and the
community of nations.","As for the Republic of China on Taiwan, that is a
case which the community of nations must examine in
the light of international realities. Resolution 2758
(XXVI) of 1971 did not resolve the issue of the
representation of the Taiwanese people in the United
Nations. That nation has developed politically,
economically and socially in an independent, free and
democratic way. It has its own institutions and
characteristics, just like any other State of the
international community. However, Taiwan’s situation
in the international community is exceptional, because
its absence from this forum is a denial of the exercise
of the rights that are recognized to other peoples and of
the universal and democratic nature of our
Organization. Our delegation therefore supports
consideration of the exceptional situation of the
population of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its
eventual participation in this forum and other
international organizations.","One of the pending items on the international
agenda that we must not disregard is the situation
related to Taiwan and its inclusion in the concert of
nations. We believe that the United Nations must look
into the question of Taiwan, because it is a reality that
we cannot ignore, since the representation of the
Taiwanese people internationally is a responsibility of
this Organization, in accordance with its universal
principles and purposes. Similarly, we hope that there
will be peaceful coexistence on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.","In the life of nations there are always special
questions that determine direction and destiny as they
move towards their future. The question of the
Republic of China in Taiwan is one of those questions.
Even though it is a political reality that has evolved in
parallel with other States and embodies all of the
characteristics needed to be a State, there is still failure
to recognize its existence. This denies the right of 23
million people of Taiwan to be represented in
international organizations and, in particular, the United Nations. We firmly believe that the situation of
Taiwan should be examined pragmatically in the light
of the current political reality. The United Nations is
the proper forum to do so — not only because it should
recognize the right of the Taiwanese people to be
represented, but also because a globalized world
should not allow exclusion or marginalization from
international cooperation. Such cooperation
strengthens efforts to combat challenges and problems
that are common to all and could undermine the quality
of life and obstruct the development of peoples. Here,
we reiterate the need to open up room for the
representation and participation of Taiwan in the
United Nations, particularly in the specialized
agencies, which by their nature are related to
humanitarian, economic and social questions. ","Taiwan is a unique political reality in the
international community. It has systematically
developed, in particular in recent years, under the
leadership of President Chen Shui-bian. He has made
his country a modern, peaceful entity that is resolutely
determined to promote peace and international
cooperation. Given that reality, we acknowledge the
legitimate right of more than 23 million Taiwanese to
determine their own future, just as other peoples have
done. That is why we support the initiative to have the
General Assembly review the case of Taiwan in the
light of current global realities, acknowledging the
right of the Taiwanese to hold a referendum on joining
this international Organization. ","As the emissary of a nation that lives in
democracy and peace, respecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms, I should like to reiterate once
again, on behalf of El Salvador, our firm support for
the aspirations of the people of the Republic of China
in Taiwan to participate in the international
institutional structure, particularly in the United
Nations system. We support the initiative to examine
the participation of that country in the specialized
agencies of the United Nations, with particular
emphasis on the fact that the people of that country
cannot and should not remain isolated from the
international community and could contribute
experience, resources and knowledge to deal with the
challenges that we all face. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Equatorial Guinea,,,,,,,,,,,,"As I noted earlier, Equatorial Guinea expresses its
satisfaction at the reduction of tensions in some
countries and regions. At the same time, it calls on and
encourages the parties involved in areas where
conflicts and disputes are born and persist to redouble
their efforts and to use their capabilities and potential
to seek peaceful solutions through peaceful
negotiations.
In this context, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms that
the People’s Republic of China is the sole State entity
that is representative of the Chinese people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuji ,,,,,"Our Prime Minister, the Honourable Major-General
Sitiveni Rabuka, greatly appreciated the warm welcome that he received during his recent visit to the People’s
Republic of China and Taiwan. Fiji remains committed to
its official relations with the People’s Republic of China but
also greatly values its trade and economic cooperation with
Taiwan. It is our sincere hope that the People’s Republic
of China and Taiwan, in continued direct talks and
negotiations, will be able to reach agreement on a
practicable basis on which to strengthen and expand
cooperation between them, including cooperation in the
international arena...One significant recent development is the post-Forum
dialogue: immediately after a Forum meeting, the Forum
island countries meet separately with their more developed
trade and economic partners to discuss development
priorities and constraints in the region. The post-Forum
dialogue partners include Canada, the People’s Republic of
China, France, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the
United States. From our perspective as small island nations
whose economies, to remain viable, depend to a very large
extent on economic ties with these larger and more
vigorous economies, we value these discussions and are
confident that they will continue. ","Indeed, proper management of resources is
increasingly becoming one of the major preoccupations of
both the aid donors and the aid recipients in our region of
the South Pacific. The South Pacific Forum had “Managing
resources” as its theme in 1994. The Forum’s deliberations
this year, which took place only last month in Papua New
Guinea, centred on the theme of “Securing development
beyond 2000”. As in previous years, the Forum island
members again had very useful discussions with aid donors
in the region in their post-Forum dialogue. We are deeply
appreciative of the opportunity to sit down together with the
donors and discuss regional issues of mutual concern. The
donors included the United States, the United Kingdom,
France, Japan, Canada, the European Union, the People’s
Republic of China, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.We believe that regional cooperation will play an
increasingly important role in the development of our
national economies. We therefore highly value our
increasing contacts with the countries members of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
economies of South-East Asia generally. This includes
Taiwan, with which we enjoy very useful and close trade,
economic and technical cooperation, just as we do with the
People’s Republic of China, with which we have strong and
unequivocally clear official relations. We believe that
Taiwan, like the People’s Republic of China, has huge
potential to contribute in a practical way to the development
of our region and to the world generally. We therefore
welcome the spirit of dialogue and cooperation between
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China and hope that
the international community at large will also be able to
benefit from such cooperation. Their increased participation
and cooperation in the activities of various international and
regional forums would certainly be welcome.  ","Recent events in the Straits of Taiwan have
highlighted the tension that exists in that region of the
world, a region which is otherwise currently witnessing a
most dynamic economic growth. Both the People’s
Republic of China and Taiwan, which are also active
participants in post-forum dialogue with the island
countries of the South Pacific Forum, contribute significantly to the development of the South Pacific region.
My country welcomes the spirit of cooperation between
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China and encourages
the continuation of such dialogue and cooperation.","Last year, I commended both the People’s Republic of
China and Taiwan for their efforts toward reconciling their
differences. I wish to renew my plea to them to work
towards unity. We in Fiji enjoy excellent relations with
both of them, though we adhere firmly to our One China
policy. We in the Pacific continue to enjoy their generosity
and their concern for the welfare of the people of the South
Pacific. Both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan
enjoy our friendship and trust. Fiji and the other 15 member
countries of the South Pacific Forum welcome their
participation in the annual post-Forum dialogue and
consultation with each of them. It is our fervent wish that
they will, together, find a solution for their common future.","The issue of Taiwan has remained unchanged. China
and Taiwan contribute significantly to the development of
the South Pacific region. My country is committed to a
one-China policy and enjoys very good relations with
both China and Taiwan. We therefore warmly welcome
the renewed talks between China and Taiwan and hope
that they will lead to profitable change on the Taiwan
issue.",,"We in Fiji have been greatly inspired by the
positive developments on the Korean peninsula, with
the growing rapprochement between the South and the
North. We express the hope that the same spirit of
goodwill and readiness to enter into dialogue will also
spread to the great country of China, between the
Peopleís Republic of China and Taiwan. With regard to the very important country of Japan, I reaffirm Fijiís
support for Japanís admission as a permanent member
of the Security Council.",,"We live in uncertain times. The world is troubled.
We look to the United Nations to provide steadiness
and balance at the centre. We look to it to maintain
peace on earth and hope for humanity. Member
countries of the Pacific Island Forum have committed
themselves to promoting and safeguarding the Pacific
Ocean as a region of peace. We appeal to all those who
are part of our wider Pacific community to embrace the
way of peace and to constructively engage in
cooperation for development. We welcome China’s
increasing presence and involvement in supporting and
assisting development in our region. China and Taiwan
have longstanding differences. All of us in the Pacific
want to see them resolve their dispute amicably
through dialogue and a common vision.","The Pacific Islands Forum now has 12 dialogue
partners, including the United States, Canada, France,
the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan,
China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India and
Taiwan. China — the emerging giant in world affairs and
trade — has a steadily growing presence in our region.
Its involvement and support for our economic and
social development is welcome. We see definite scope for trade, investment, cultural and tourism links. China,
many commentators believe, already has the world’s
second largest economy. Its present aid programme is
significant and we expect it to grow substantially as
bilateral relationships grow stronger.
At the same time, we place great value on our
trade and commerce with Taiwan and value its
assistance to our development. We look forward to the
day when China and Taiwan peacefully resolve their
long-standing differences.","We are glad to see the People’s Republic of China
growing in stature and developing so quickly. Fiji enjoys
steadily strengthening relations with China and wants to
see those relations expanded further. It is committed to its
diplomatic recognition and official relations with the People’s Republic of China. At the same time, Fiji values
its trade and economic ties with Taiwan. It is our fervent
hope that their people will resolve their future
peacefully through dialogue and consensus.","We look forward to the moment when peace
finally reigns in the Middle East, and we commend all
those countries that are helping with that global cause.
For our Pacific Ocean region, we would like to see the
Korean people find just peace and lasting harmony. On
the future of Taiwan, it is Fiji’s fervent hope that a
resolution through dialogue, conducted in the true
spirit of reconciliation and understanding and devoid of
violence, can be found — one that is agreeable to all
parties and that can last for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gambia,,,,,,"It is regrettable, though, that it has not been possible
to discuss the readmission of the Republic of China on
Taiwan on the basis of the same principle. Considering its
population of 21 million and the fact that it is one of the
world’s leading economies, my delegation sincerely believes that the Republic of China on Taiwan, readmitted
as a full Member, would make significant contributions to
the work of the United Nations. It is hoped that such a
move would also facilitate the process of reunification.","The quest for peace is a universal concern of the
international community. At the same time, the desire for
equality and recognition continues to elude some nations.
The Republic of China on Taiwan’s quest for recognition
and readmission into the United Nations has failed to have
the necessary impact on the attitude and goodwill of the
international community. Today, the Republic of China on
Taiwan stands very high in the international arena in the
field of economic growth and social development. It is
noted not only for its economic achievements, but also for
its exemplary political reform. The direct election of its
President on 23 March 1996, an event unprecedented in
Chinese history, marked the culmination of Taiwan’s
political democratization. This accomplishment ought to be
recognized by the United Nations, in accordance also with
the principle of universality. My country believes that the
precedent of parallel United Nations membership, which
applied to the former East Germany and West Germany and
currently applies to North Korea and South Korea, should
be applied in the case of the Republic of China on Taiwan.
Besides the membership factor, which is in accordance
with Article 4 of the United Nations Charter, there is a
justice factor relating to Articles 1 and 2 of the same
Charter. It is regrettable that this factor was not included in
our debate when the matter was considered at the meeting
of the General Committee of the General Assembly, held
on 18 September 1996, in connection with the item on the
draft agenda entitled “Consideration of the exceptional
situation of the inability, resulting from General Assembly
resolution 2758 (XXVI), of the 21.3 million people on
Taiwan, Republic of China, to participate in the activities
of the United Nations”. As we all know, one can quantify
numbers of signatures, but not emotions — that is,
sympathy with and an interest and belief in the justification
and rightness of the case of Taiwan. It is our conviction
that the parallel participation of the two sides of the Taiwan
strait in the United Nations and other international
organizations would be conducive to the maintenance of
peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world in general. Let us therefore give the Republic of
China on Taiwan the opportunity to share with us their
capabilities and experience in a collective effort to realize
humankind’s hope for the equitable development of every
region of the world.","In this regard, my delegation strongly supports the
aspiration of the 21.3 million people of the Republic of
China on Taiwan to exercise their right to share and
participate in the activities of intergovernmental
organizations on international cooperation by joining this
comity of nations. The legitimacy of their aspirations,
both legal and national, has been reinforced by similar
actions and measures taken by the United Nations on the
issue of parallel representation, which now serve as useful
reminders and examples. The Taiwan question is also a
test of the international community’s interpretation of
democracy. As we are all aware, the Republic of China
on Taiwan has existed, physically, legally and politically,
since the foundation of the United Nations. My
Government therefore believes that our Organization will
do itself a great service by admitting Taiwan into our
midst, in the true spirit of the application of democratic
principles. The presence of the Republic of China on
Taiwan among us can only enrich our Organization. In
this regard, we therefore believe that resolution 2758
(XXVI) adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the General
Assembly, needs to be reviewed.","It is the wholehearted belief of my delegation that
every people has a right to self-determination. This belief
inspires the Gambia’s strong support for the aspirations of
the 21.3 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to exercise their right to share and participate in the
activities of the United Nations. The legitimacy of their
aspirations, both legal and moral, has been reinforced by
similar actions and measures taken by the United Nations
on the issue of parallel representation, which now stands as
a useful reminder.","How do we achieve this noble objective? First of all,
we must commit ourselves to living and working for
peace on earth. We must respect the sovereign rights of
nations, big or small, rich or poor, to exist without fear of
being marginalized, suppressed or intimidated by larger,
richer or more populous nations. This is why, quite apart
from the principle of universality, my Government sincerely believes that this body should seriously reconsider
its position on the readmission of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to the United Nations. With a population of almost
22 million and the nineteenth-largest economy in the world,
and being the fifteenth-largest trading nation, the Republic
of China — a highly responsible member of the
international community, a free and democratic country that
has always promoted world trade and socio-economic
development around the world and at the same time has
contributed to the eradication of poverty — has a lot to
offer if readmitted to the United Nations. By allowing the
22 million people in Taiwan to be represented in the United
Nations, we would be enforcing the principles enshrined in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as
contributing to the promotion of international peace and
security.
Where this Assembly has recognized the then
existence of two Germanies and the present existence of the
two Koreas, the logic of the readmission of the Republic of
China into this Assembly of nations is a matter of justice
and equity. How can the United Nations sideline such an
important country as if we were still living in the past?
For reasons that we all know too well, in 1971, the
General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), by
which it conferred membership upon the People's Republic
of China. But the same resolution failed miserably to
address the issue of representation in the United Nations for
the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The cold
war is over. The time has now come to correct this sad
mistake, and there could not be a better time than now,
when we are at the threshold of the twenty-first century, to
recognize the Republic of China and, by extension, the
voice of its 22 million people.","Meanwhile, we are here yet again to reason with
the Assembly about the pressing need to reconsider its
position with regard to the case of the Republic of
China on Taiwan. At this moment, when we the United
Nations are at a crossroads, when history is in the
making, when we are talking about inclusiveness,
universality, globalization, democratization — and the
list goes on — it defies logic that a country of 23
million people, with all that they have to offer to the
rest of mankind, is continuously barred from
participating in the work and activities of the United
Nations. The Republic of China has a national flag,
national ceremonies and systems that are recognized all
over the world. It is also one of the most advanced in
the field of technology and electronics, agriculture and
medicine.
Here is a country relatively small in size, but in
terms of social, economic, financial, cultural,
technological and scientific achievements, the Republic
of China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckoned
with, a formidable powerhouse. This country has
always espoused everything that our Organization
stands for: its purposes and principles, its aims and
objectives, its shared values and dreams. The Republic
of China is not discouraged. We must in the spirit of
democracy and justice allow it to hoist its flag as an
independent nation in this edifice of the United
Nations. It is my delegation’s firm belief that this historic
occasion of the Millennium Summit is the time to
embrace opportunities, make progress on issues that
divide us, move forward and look to the future with
confidence, rather than living in the past, burying our
heads in the sand or turning the other way. If we look
closely at the documents prepared for the Millennium
Summit — whether the one introduced by the
Secretary-General or the working draft prepared by the
General Assembly President — it will be seen that on
almost all the issues raised in these important
documents the Republic of China has much to offer. Let us take human rights, democracy and good
governance. It will be recalled that on 18 March this
year, the Republic of China held its second presidential
election. Nearly 12.8 million people, approximately 83
per cent of all eligible voters in Taiwan, participated in
the election, vigorously contested by candidates from all political parties. The opposition won the election,
which resulted in an unprecedented transition of power
from one political party to another, in an orderly and
peaceful process. After that result the country still
seeks to be a part of this house.
In the area of development and poverty
eradication, we have witnessed on a number of
occasions how the Republic of China has, through its
International Economic Cooperation and Development
Fund, been collaborating with such agencies as the
Asian Development Bank, the Central American Bank
for Economic Integration and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to support
development projects around the world.
As for the crucial sector of information and
communications technology and the revolution in this
field, it is an open secret that the Republic of China is
in the vanguard. We will be talking a great deal about
the growing digital divide. We have to bridge this
divide, and it goes without saying that one of the major
pillars of this bridge is the Republic of China.
How, then, can this country be excluded from the
United Nations family? Furthermore, in this era of
globalization and liberalization, it is impossible to
understand how a leading trading nation like the
Republic of China could be excluded from playing its
rightful role in the comity of nations. The Republic of
China is one of the most successful examples of
economic development in the twentieth century and is
now the world’s nineteenth largest economy in terms of
gross domestic product and the fourteenth most
important trading nation. And, yes, it possesses the
third largest amount of foreign reserves in the world.
What is even more praiseworthy is that the
Republic of China has over the years sent more than
10,000 experts to train technicians in countries all over
the world, especially in developing countries. In
addition, it has also been providing disaster relief
around the world amounting to billions of dollars. This
country continues to respond promptly and positively
to United Nations appeals for emergency relief and
rehabilitation for countries suffering from natural
disasters and wars.
It will also be useful and helpful to talk about
cross-strait relations just to show that the door to
dialogue is not completely shut between the arranged and 100 million letters and phone calls
exchanged. Last year alone some 2 million visits were
exchanged. We note with a sense of great satisfaction
that cross-strait trade totalled $27 billion. These figures
speak volumes. This is why we believe that we should
not only take note of, but also support, the conciliatory
gestures of the Republic of China towards the People’s
Republic of China, especially the request for a summit
to pursue cross-strait reconciliation efforts without
specifying any preconditions, format or location. The
newly elected President of the Republic of China even
went further, by expressing the hope that the leaders of
the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of
China would respect the free choice of the people on
both sides and work together to resolve the question of
a future one China.
While working to achieve that goal, we, the
United Nations, should help the process by considering
how both sides of the Taiwan Strait can participate at
the same time in the United Nations. We are confident
that, as was the case with the former East Germany and
the former West Germany, parallel representation of
divided nations in the United Nations — in addition to
contributing to regional peace and security — can lead
to their peaceful unification. Republic
of China and the People’s Republic of China. In fact
since 1987 more than 12 million visits have been","Similarly, it is our fervent hope that one day the
Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China will unite but, as the saying goes, let
us put first things first. As clearly stated by my
delegation during the meeting of the General
Committee, the Government of the Gambia would like
to reiterate that the exceptional situation of the
Republic of China on Taiwan needs to be reconsidered
by this body. Only a few days ago, the Republic of
China on Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade
Organization (WTO). That is no mean achievement
and, therefore, my delegation would like to take this
opportunity to congratulate the Government and the 23
million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We
in the Gambia have no doubt that they will make
constructive contributions to the work of the WTO. It
will be recalled that the Republic of China on Taiwan
is now the world’s seventeenth largest economy in
terms of gross national product (GNP) and the fifteenth
most important trading nation. Considering that the
Republic of China on Taiwan possesses the world’s
third largest foreign reserves, in addition to its strategic
position as the sixteenth largest foreign direct investor,
it does not make much sense to continue to exclude it
from the United Nations. Politics aside, the Republic of
China on Taiwan has a lot to offer the international
community. For instance, in the crucial area of
information and communication technologies (ICT),
the real revolution of our times, the Republic of China
on Taiwan is in the vanguard. We all know that the
issue of ICT is among the top priorities of the United
Nations and we therefore look forward to the special
event on Tuesday, 20 November, when the SecretaryGeneral will launch the United Nations Information
and Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force.
How will we be able to benefit from the expertise of
the Republic of China on Taiwan when it is excluded
from the work of the United Nations? The Republic of China on Taiwan is active in
other important areas as well, especially development
cooperation, by providing experts and through
international financial institutions, and, likewise, in the
humanitarian field by providing disaster relief to
countries in need. The case of the Republic of China on
Taiwan is unique. It is exceptional and should be
treated as such, quite apart from observing the
principle of universality.","Sabres are rattling on one side of the Taiwan
Strait in the face of 23 million souls, for their merely
having claimed their God-given right to be recognized
as a political, economic and social entity. The Republic
of China on Taiwan is today the only country on earth
that is not represented in the United Nations, contrary
to the main guiding principle of the United Nations: the
principle of universality. Article four of the Charter
invites “all ... peace-loving States” to become Members
of the Organization. The people of Taiwan have
demonstrated over the years not only that they are
peace-loving but also that they can contribute to all the
objectives of the United Nations in the fields of global security, financial stability, culture, industrial and
technological growth and sustainable development.
Taiwan is not an insignificant player in the world
production and trade arena. It is the world’s sixteenth
largest economy. It is equally highly developed in the
field of scientific and medical research.
In recognition of its importance as a trading
nation, it was recently admitted into the World Trade
Organization. Logic demands that, for the very same
reason, it should also be admitted into the World
Health Organization in recognition of its importance as
a country of highly sophisticated and developed health
services; into the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization because of its
exceptionally high standing in the fields of science and
culture; into the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization because of its most
advanced industrial and technological development;
into the United Nations Children’s Fund because of its
highly developed child development policies and
programmes; into the Food and Agriculture
Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development and the World Food Programme because
of its extremely well developed agriculture and its
importance as a food producer; and into the United
Nations Development Programme because of its huge
official development assistance to developing countries
for capacity-building and poverty alleviation. In short,
it should be admitted into all branches of the United
Nations family because of the tremendous
contributions it could make to the ideals and
programmes of the United Nations.
Taiwan is a vibrant democracy with high ratings
on human rights, press freedom and the observance of
the rights of the individual. It could contribute
immensely to global security and the fight against
terrorism. It is therefore baffling that this highly
developed, friendly and peace-loving nation has been
barred from membership in the United Nations for
purely political reasons. My Government will not rest
until this injustice is undone and the Republic of China
on Taiwan is granted its rightful place among the
comity of nations.","A peculiar situation of exclusion was created by
General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) on
25 October 1971, which relates, through its direct
effects, to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1971, the Republic of
China (Taiwan) was a bona fide member of the United
Nations, recognized by the comity of nations. If the
Republic of China (Taiwan) could be a member of the
United Nations then, why could it not be a member
now? The General Assembly adopted resolution 2758
(XXVI), which addressed only the question of the
representation of the People’s Republic of China at the
United Nations and related organizations. It did not
decide that Taiwan was, or should be, a part of the
People’s Republic of China. Nor did it confer on the
People’s Republic of China the right to represent the
Republic of China (Taiwan) or the 23 million
Taiwanese people in the United Nations and related
organizations. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has since been
misused to justify the exclusion of Taiwan from the
United Nations. That runs counter to the claim by the
Government of the People’s Republic of China that it
represents the interests of all Chinese, not to mention
those Taiwanese who are in the Republic of China
(Taiwan). If we are to comprehensively deal with the problems engendered by exclusion in whatever form it
takes, I call on the international community to revisit
that issue urgently.",,"As we clamour for reform and renewal of our
Organization, we should widen our horizons and
undertake a sober and dispassionate reassessment of
our policy towards the Republic of Taiwan. The
concerns of the 23 million hard-working and peaceloving people of that great country continue to be
ignored. The Republic of Taiwan is a democratic,
sovereign State. Its democratically elected Government
defends the interests of the people of Taiwan in the
world. The Taiwanese people display the same concern
we all do about global problems such as international
peace and security, HIV/AIDS, the spread of disease,
environmental pollution, and all the other issues that
engage us at the United Nations. Yet, they are not here
at the table with us, contributing their share in the
search for solutions to the problems that confront
humankind today. We therefore call on all the peaceloving nations of the world to support the participation
of the Republic of Taiwan in all the affairs of the
United Nations as a full Member without delay. The
twenty-first-century United Nations should include all
people the world over without political discrimination.
The United Nations should also be committed to that
goal: a twenty-first-century, reformed United Nations
that includes the people of the Republic of Taiwan.
Their plight is more sharply amplified by our present
preoccupation with the conflicts raging today that pose
a serious threat to international peace and security.","While we must obviously intervene to contain
and arrest raging conflicts, we must not be oblivious to the need to pay equal attention to nascent conflict
situations. One such situation is that which is
prevailing across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s
Republic of China has openly threatened Taiwan with
military intervention, should it as much as express an
intention to declare itself independent. In addition, the
People’s Republic of China has increased its arsenal of
missiles trained on Taiwan to over 800 warheads. It
goes without saying that a deterioration of the situation
into all-out war will only provoke an unwelcome mix
of responses from allies within and without the region,
responses that could cause a conflagration that would
make the Middle East situation pale in comparison.  By the same token, we must also urgently address
the question of Taiwan. The legitimate quest of the
people of Taiwan for a voice and standing in the United
Nations must be ignored no longer. Taiwan is an
important actor in our global economy and contributes
immensely to global peace and security. It must be
formally granted recognition as a responsible member
of the international community. A simple way to grant
that recognition would be to give Taiwan its rightful
place in the United Nations. ","The Gambian delegation sincerely hopes as well
that the international community will reflect deeply on
the dangers posed by the increasing and unprovoked
militarization of the Taiwan Strait. Regional and,
ultimately, international stability are under threat from
the build-up of thousands of military warheads for use
in attacks on Taiwan. The problem of the Taiwan Strait
is one that is very serious indeed, and which calls for
urgent action by the international community. The
United Nations should not wait until it is too late to
address the situation of the Strait and its growing
militarization. We, the Members of the United Nations, have at
this juncture abdicated our responsibilities towards
Taiwan by refusing it full membership in the
Organization. The legitimate aspirations of the people
of that dynamic, technologically developed, advanced
economic powerhouse ought to be fulfilled by States
Members of the United Nations. Let me seize this
opportunity to assure the Assembly that my delegation
is not acting against the interest of any Member State.
Rather, we speak out in the interest of peace across the
Taiwan Strait, peace throughout the Asia-Pacific region
and, indeed, peace in the whole world. It is in that
spirit that my delegation will continue to call on the
General Assembly to address this threat to international
peace and security. ","Allow me now to address some neglected issues
of international justice. My delegation has always
addressed the question of Taiwan in this Assembly
from the point of view of justice, fairness and equality.
Taiwan is a stable and prosperous democracy that is
willing and able to take part in the work that the
Organization does. How can one justify the exclusion
of Taiwan from actively participating in the activities
of United Nations agencies? Safeguarding the welfare
of the 23 million Taiwanese through their participation should be accepted under the principle of universality.
For example, although it has the world’s tenth largest
shipping capacity, Taiwan does not have access to the
International Maritime Organization. That adversely
affects the progress of its shipping industry.
 Furthermore, as the world’s eighth largest
economy and twentieth largest foreign investor, Taiwan
possesses significant economic strength and continues
to share its development experiences with many
developing countries through technical and
humanitarian assistance. Taiwan is supporting the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
and other internationally agreed development goals. I
therefore strongly believe that we should all agree to
let Taiwan participate in the activities of the
specialized agencies of the United Nations. That is a
modest request that my delegation fervently hopes
merits the Assembly’s objective consideration. ","Secondly, there is also the lingering issue of the
Republic of China on Taiwan. My delegation holds the
position that Taiwan should be invited to participate in
all meetings and activities of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
International Civil Aviation Organization, among other
bodies. Taiwan has a legitimate right to full
membership of all United Nations specialized agencies,
since even non-governmental organizations have either
full membership or observer status in those agencies.
Taiwan, a democratic State with a population of
23 million, is still being denied this fundamental
human right, which the United Nations is supposed to
uphold and protect in the first place. ","We also urge that all sovereign States that have a
legitimate Government based on the will and consent
of their people be admitted to the United Nations, and
this applies in particular to the Republic of China on
Taiwan. We commend the countries on both sides of
the Strait for their continuous progress in pursuing
peace and shelving disputes over the past two years.
While both States deserve special recognition and more
encouragement, the United Nations also needs to be
cognizant of the efforts by Taiwan in this peaceful
process. It is important to note that Taiwan’s invitation
to participate in the World Health Assembly as an
observer in 2009 and 2010 not only enhanced
international health and medical care networks, but
also set a positive example for Taiwan’s participation.
We therefore urge all Member States to ensure that
other specialized agencies are opened up to Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in the work of the United
Nations.
 Taiwan is contributing immensely to the
international community through trade, investment, air
transport, finance, telecommunications technology and
environmental protection in the spirit of international
cooperation. Therefore, we call upon the United
Nations to find a proper way to accept Taiwan’s
participation in all its specialized agencies, notably the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
 The international community needs to recognize
that Taiwan has adopted and pursued a pragmatic,
moderate and steady foreign policy, and we therefore
encourage United Nations specialized agencies to be
open-minded with regard to Taiwan’s participation in
their activities. It is our collective responsibility to
enable the 23 million people of Taiwan to participate more visibly and make them able to function within the
international system. ","The case of Taiwan deserves better scrutiny by
the international community. Taiwan, with a population  of 23 million people, continues to play an active and
positive role on the international stage. In a highly
integrated and interconnected world, almost all issues
demand the full participation of and cooperation
among all nations. Taiwan’s efforts in promoting peace,
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, deserve
commendation and further encouragement by the
General Assembly.  For example, over the past three years, Taiwan
has engaged mainland China in dialogue on a wide
range of issues ranging from agriculture and health to
intellectual property rights and economic and
commercial cooperation, among others. Furthermore,
since 2009 Taiwan has been invited by the World
Health Organization to attend the World Health
Assembly (WHA) as an observer. That practice and the
related arrangements have established what has been
termed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent
for Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations
system generally.
 Given that Taiwan is today one of the leading
technological and economic powerhouses of the world,
its participation in global affairs is quite relevant,
bearing in mind the numerous issues that we
collectively confront. We must give it the prominence
that it deserves. Issues such as natural disasters,
terrorism, climate change, epidemics, financial
meltdowns and many others require the engagement of
every member of the international community,
including Taiwan. We therefore urge the United
Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in the specialized agencies
and mechanisms of the United Nations system,
including the International Civil Aviation Organization
and the United Nations Climate Change Conferences
immediately. ","“My delegation would also like to use this
rostrum to appeal to the collective membership of
the United Nations, including China, to contribute
to opening the avenues for Taiwan’s membership
in the various funds, agencies, treaty bodies
and programmes. That would only enhance the
effectiveness of those bodies for our mutual benefit.
The world, not only Taiwan, stands to benefit. We
all agree that Taiwan is a key player in technology,
international trade, politics and many other areas. It
has enduring ties with China. We therefore appeal
for the practical extension of the rapport that Taiwan has with China to the international stage. China
conducts trade, business and tourism with Taiwan.
As I speak, both are engaging in discussing a range
of bilateral issues. The rest of the international
community, including the States Members of the
United Nations, should follow suit. Avenues for
dialogue must be opened.","We also reiterate our call for a serious and decisive
reassessment of our policy towards the Republic
of China on Taiwan. The concerns of the 23 million
hard-working and peace-loving people of that great country continue to be ignored. The Republic of China
on Taiwan has a democratically elected Government,
which is the only legitimate Government that defends
the interests of the people of Taiwan in the conduct of
world affairs and in its many serious interactions with
each and every nation of the world. The Taiwanese
people have the same concerns as all of us with regard
to global problems. Yet they are not a member of the
vital organs of the global body to contribute their share
in the search for solutions to those problems.",,,,"In our foreign policy, as part of our historic
friendship we fully recognize the One China policy. The
People’s Republic of China is the sole representative of
the Chinese people and a true friend of The Gambia.
Our two countries continue to strengthen cooperation
on the basis of a win-win approach, built on mutual
trust and respect within the framework of the Forum on
China-Africa Cooperation.","My Government reaffirms its strong support
for a two-State solution to establish peace between
the Palestinians and their neighbours. We also
unconditionally recognize the One China policy.
Similarly, we recognize the support provided by the
Government and the people of Bangladesh to address
the plight of the Rohingya Muslims. As the upcoming
Chair of the next summit of the Organization of Islamic
Cooperation, the Gambia has undertaken, through a
resolution, to champion an accountability mechanism
that would ensure that perpetrators of the terrible crimes
against the Rohingya Muslims are brought to book.","As a pillar of our foreign policy engagement
with the Peoples Republic of China, we recognize
only one China in our mutual quest to enhance and
nurture friendly relations, based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. We also believe that the evolution
of our relations is built on shared prosperity and a
win-win approach.","To promote friendly relations between States, The Gambia calls for the
normalisation of relations between Cuba and the United States. In the same vein, we
fully endorse the one-China policy, and look forward to stronger, mutually beneficial
international cooperation with the Peoples’ Republic of China."
Greece,,,,,,,,,,"Let me take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt
condolences to the victims of the recent disastrous
earthquake in Taiwan, and to their families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grenada,,,,"The promotion of democracy and the enhancement of
human rights must be vigorously pursued. The process of
democratization has to be entrenched. My delegation,
moreover, looks forward to welcoming to the United
Nations, in the near future, the Republic of China on
Taiwan. With its 21 million people, the Republic of China
on Taiwan, has, over the past 20 years, progressed
economically, socially and democratically to the point where
it can no longer properly be kept out of the United Nations.
The Republic of China on Taiwan has established diplomatic
relations with a number of countries and has significantly
contributed to the uplifting of the struggling economies of a
great number of countries and the development of their
peoples. Surely, these impressive achievements eminently
qualify the Republic of China on Taiwan for admission to
this Organization.","Grenada supports the principle of universality and
encourages the General Assembly to give renewed
consideration to the wish of the Republic of China - a
founding Member of the United Nations - to participate
in the Organization and its specialized agencies as a full
Member. We believe that this appeal from the 21 million
people of the Republic of China in Taiwan for a voice
and proper representation in the international community is both moral and legitimate. The inclusion of the Republic
of China in Taiwan in the United Nations would further
contribute to global cooperation in trade, economic
development and environmental and ecological protection.
In addition, it would assist in the promotion of international
development assistance to developing countries. Grenada
believes that a committee should be set up to examine the
exceptional nature of the situation of the Republic of China
in the present international context.","But as we meet today the Republic of China on
Taiwan and its more than 21 million people remain
excluded from participation and representation in the
United Nations. It is on the basis of that principle of
universality that Grenada urges all Members to consider
that, in renewing our oaths, we should forthwith seek to
right this wrong. The inclusion of the Republic of China
will be an added contribution to global cooperation in
fields such as trade, economic development,
environmental protection, sustainable development and
multilateral efforts to fight drug trafficking. Moreover, the
Republic of China is committed to the promotion of
international development assistance to developing
countries.
Grenada wishes to urge again that an ad hoc
committee be set up at the earliest possible time to
consider the special case of the Republic of China on
Taiwan and respond positively to its wish to join this
world Organization.","In July of this year, the European Union, through its
Parliament, adopted a resolution to support the call for
participation in international organizations by the Republic
of China. The Government and people of Grenada
consider this action on the part of the European Union to
have been a most significant development. We welcome
this development, and we applaud the European Union for
it. Indeed, we are encouraged by that action, for the
persistent plea of Grenada, constantly repeated over
several years in every appropriate forum, has now been
amplified into a clarion call for moral justice, in contrast
to the expediency of power politics, economic advantage
and legislative manipulation of yesteryear.
The Republic of China has for many years
consistently displayed its commitment to the values and
principles of this body. Indeed, in the face of threats and
undisguised acts of aggression, the courageous people of
the Republic of China boldly chose to embark upon a
path of freedom, justice, and respect for human rights,
and recently took part in their presidential election, which
was open, free and fair. The economic achievements of this brave country of
21.3 million people are well and widely known. Thus, there
can be no doubt as to the capability of the people of the
Republic of China to make substantial contributions to the
work of the United Nations. As to their willingness to make
significant contributions, that also cannot be a matter of
doubt. They have given testimony in this regard in several
ways. They have established their good faith. They deserve
the right to participate in the conferences and activities of
the United Nations system. To continue to deny them this
right would be to persist in denying them justice within the
confraternity of nations.
Superior power is found only where there is superior
excellence of some kind, and the Republic of China has
manifested a certain degree of superior power which
derives from virtue rather than from physical strength.
Thus, the Government and people of Grenada unequivocally
exhort this Assembly to secure participation by the
Republic of China in the agencies and activities of the
United nations system.","The very notion of equity inevitably calls forth the
notion of justice. In the context of justice in the United
Nations, there arises quite effortlessly the case of the
Republic of China on Taiwan. To all who subscribe to the
principle of the right of a people to self-determination, the
case for membership in the United Nations for the
Republic of China on Taiwan is a compelling one.
Indeed, it is incontestable. For, some 50 years ago, these
people chose self-determination. They voted with their
feet as they moved from their homes on mainland China
to the island of Taiwan, and today 21.3 million people
practise democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan.
Their economic achievements are well and widely known, as is their willingness to participate in the international
community as a Member of the United Nations.
What more is required for the Republic of China to be
admitted to United Nations membership? One may well
ask. My answer: justice. The mention of justice evokes
recollection of two very insightful observations which
deserve to be shared in this noble Assembly. First,
Reinhold Niebur, in his Foreword to “The Children of Light
and the Children of Darkness”, offered the following
comment on justice:
“Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy
possible; but Man’s inclination to injustice makes
democracy necessary.”
Well might we enquire as to the origin of this
inclination to injustice. But the success or failure to identify
that origin notwithstanding, an effective manner of dealing
with that inclination is provided by Plato’s construct for
education, which is centred on exposure of the soul to the
right things.","The people of the Republic of China on Taiwan —
and they number more than 22 million — have exercised
the right to participate in international organizations,
including the United Nations. And in the further exercise
of that right, they have chosen to contribute
internationally towards the realization by the peoples of
the less developed countries of the fullness of their human
dignity. And the Republic of China on Taiwan has chosen
to do so within the compass of certain regional and
international organizations which are associated in one
way or another with the United Nations system. To deny
those 22 million people the right to exercise that choice
is to violate their human right to choose. Further, to
engage in such denial is also to enforce a restriction on
the enjoyment of enhanced benefit by the peoples of
States which are members of those organizations.
Grenada therefore calls for the granting to the
Republic of China on Taiwan of an appropriate form of
membership that would allow for participation by the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the World Health
Organization, the World Trade Organization and the
Caribbean Development Bank.","Grenada is absolutely clear about its commitment to
the principles of the United Nations and therefore reveres
the ideals which informed those principles. Grenada thus
places a premium on fairness and justice in the conduct of
international affairs. It is in this context that the
Government of Grenada wishes to request that a fresh look
be taken at United Nations General Assembly resolution
2758 (XXVI) of 1971, as a matter of simple justice and
fairness to the people of the Republic of China. This
humanitarian-minded and democratically inclined country
has used its hard-earned resources to help developing
countries to help themselves, by providing training,
expertise and capital for developmental projects and other
forms of technical assistance in several critical areas. The
noble efforts of the Republic of China reminds one of the
great Chinese philosopher, Confucius, and his thoughts on
giving a man a fish and teaching a man to fish, Grenada applauds the sacrifices of the Republic of China in this
regard.
Indeed, the Republic of China has wrought an
economic miracle, to the point where it is the fourteenth
most important trading country and its foreign reserves
rank among the top in the world.
The international community cannot simply ignore
the aspirations of such a dynamic and generous people,
and should thus ensure that the fundamental right of the
22 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
participate in the activities of the United Nations be fully
respected.","I join my Prime Minister in paying tribute to, and
publicly thanking, the Government and the people of
the Republic of China on Taiwan for the assistance
given to Grenada with respect to agriculture, marine
resources, education, health, culture and infrastructure.
The friendship and sincerity of the Republic of China
on Taiwan have been a source of strength and
endurance for our two countries. 1t is in this spirit that
Grenada calls once more for the return of the Republic
of China on Taiwan to full membership of the United
Nations. A people that diligently works to achieve such
high levels of human and technological development
and a people that makes such positive contributions to
the global economy must become a full Member of this
great organization, the United Nations.","Now, I turn to the issue of the Republic of China
on Taiwan. Grenada believes that a country that
exhibits fortitude and that has moved its economy from
poor and underdeveloped to affluent and prosperous
deserves recognition. A country that consistently shows
international responsibility surely deserves to be
admitted to this community of nations. The time has
come to reconsider the exclusion of the Republic of
China on Taiwan from membership of the United
Nations. The Republic of China is home to 23 million
people. It is a free and democratic country, and a
peace-loving member of the international community.
In economic terms, the Republic of China on Taiwan is
the seventeenth largest economy in the world, the
eighth largest investor in and fourth largest exporter of
information technology products, and the third largest
holder of foreign reserves. It is preposterous to
continue to keep such a country outside the world
body.
The Government of Grenada appeals for that
wrong to be corrected. We are therefore requesting that
the United Nations recognize the natural right of the
people of Taiwan to become active participants in this
Organization. We believe that the Government and the
people of Taiwan are seeking to participate in the
United Nations and to contribute constructively to the international community. Grenada urges that they be
given that opportunity and that right.
Grenada, however, notes with satisfaction the
admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into the
World Trade Organisation. It is the hope of my
delegation that the past, present and future performance
of Taiwan as a major democratic and international
economic player, although Taiwan is not now a
member of the United Nations, will in the not-toodistant future enable it to regain its rightful place in the
family of nations.","Grenada awaits the time when the United Nations
will include the Republic of China on Taiwan in its
membership. The Government of Grenada has close
and collaborative ties with the Republic of China and
has witnessed its economic achievements, seen
demonstrations of its democratic principles, and is
cognizant of the dedication of its people to
international norms and ideals. In this spirit Grenada
calls for the full membership of the Republic of China
on Taiwan in the United Nations. We are convinced
that the Republic of China on Taiwan meets the
standards for United Nations membership, since it has
a democratic Government and possesses the attributes
of a nation-State. Indeed, the Republic of China on
Taiwan has tremendous potential to provide inputs for
the further development of the international
community, as recognized by the World Trade
Organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guatemala,,,"In this context, the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the largest
economies in the world, is in a position to contribute significantly to
seeking solutions to problems that nations of the world must face. Its
presence in the United Nations would strengthen our Organization and permit
more appropriate treatment of topics with global implications, such as that of
the environment. Consequently, Guatemala appeals for consideration of the
need for participation by the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of our
Organization, in addition to the People's Republic of China. ","In keeping with the principle of universality prevailing
in the current international context, our country considers
that cases like that of the Republic of China in Taiwan should be thoroughly studied and considered in the light of
the United Nations Charter. Guatemala renews its faith and
hope in multilateralism, and particularly in the United
Nations. It wishes to stress its tradition of peace, dialogue
and negotiation and the non-use of force in international
relations.","This gives full validity to the principle of
universality, which should prevail in the United Nations.
And this belief prompts us to touch on the question of a
country which is capable of making a significant
contribution to the search for solutions to the problems
that the nations of the world must face. The entry of the
Republic of China, Taiwan, into the United Nations
would strengthen the Organization, permitting and
encouraging it to deal properly with topics with global
implications.","We are convinced that unless the fundamental
principle of universality is fully observed, our
Organization will be unable fully to attain its purposes.
We therefore urge consideration of the situation of the
Republic of China in Taiwan so that this country may
have a forum in which to discuss its future peacefully
with its historical brethren.","Guatemala attaches great importance to the principle
of universality that must characterize the United Nations,
and this leads us to express our conviction that the Republic
of China on Taiwan must also be fully represented in our
Organization and must actively participate in the search for
solutions in this new global, interdependent world. In our
opinion, and taking into account earlier positive
experiences, this in no way contradicts any effort at
reunification.",,"The United Nations, founded in 1945 on the ideal of
keeping peace in the world and with the fundamental role
of ensuring that all nations can coexist on the basis of
mutual respect among States, is the highest expression of
representation by all peoples. However, 53 years after the
birth of the United Nations, there are still territories
whose citizens are not represented here. My country is
aware of the divisions that persist between brothers in the
Middle East, Asia and Africa. We hope that their
differences can be resolved through dialogue and in a
peaceful manner, so that, without any form of rejection or discrimination, all the peoples of the world may be
represented in the United Nations.
I wish to mention in particular the situation of the 22
million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan, as
well as the importance and soundness of their economy
amid so much financial uncertainty in that region.","We wish to reiterate to the Assembly our concern
about the situation of the 22 million inhabitants of the
Republic of China in Taiwan whose aspirations for
representation in international organizations have not been
satisfied.","Similarly, by way of general comment, we wish
to reiterate, before this Assembly, that Guatemala, in
its very flesh, has experienced fratricidal confrontation.
That is why Guatemala has the moral authority to
insist, before God and man, that peace reign among all
the peoples of the world, particularly between the
separated brothers of China and Taiwan. We therefore
appeal for the continuation of talks in order to achieve
an outcome that will fulfil the aspirations of the
Chinese people on both sides of the Strait, reached
through peaceful, free and democratic means.","As to our position on other international conflicts,
we voice the hope that the differences or divisions that
persist between fraternal peoples in the Middle East,
Asia and Africa will yield to resolution peacefully
through dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity to
reiterate before this Assembly our concern over the
situation of the 23 million citizens of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, whose aspiration to be represented in
international organizations has not yet been fully
satisfied. The Central American countries in general,
and Guatemala in particular, believe they could indeed
make a positive contribution to peace and democracy in
the world.","My country is aware of the divisions between
sister peoples in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We
fervently hope that it will be possible to resolve those
differences by peaceful means through dialogue so that,
without discrimination, all the peoples of the world can
be represented here. I would like to make special
reference to the 23 million people of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, whose aspirations to participate in
the work of international organizations have not yet been fulfilled. The countries of Central America in
general, and Guatemala in particular, view those
aspirations as beneficial to global peace and
democracy; they deserve our support.","We support the heartfelt aspiration of the 23
million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
be represented in international organizations such as
the United Nations. Guatemala, like all of Central
America, believes those aspirations to be a positive

issue of the implementation of WTO accords, the
consolidation of special and differentiated treatment set
forth in the various WTO agreements, consolidated
market access for the products of the least developed
countries to the markets of the developed countries,
and access to essential drugs for the poorest
populations of the world that are particularly
vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. I

accession to full membership of the WTO and reiterate
the support of the Guinean Government for the position
positing a single China.","My Government reaffirms its attachment to the
principle of one China.","The Guinean Government reaffirms its

Guinea-Bissau,,,"The Republic of Guinea-Bissau, again within the context of the quest for
peace and harmony among nations, has undertaken diplomatic relations of
cooperation and friendship with all countries throughout the world that
fervently seek peace and justice.
Guided by this thinking, we also maintain diplomatic relations of
cooperation and friendship with the Republic of China (Taiwan). That is why
we support and endorse the reference made to that country by the President of
Nicaragua from this rostrum.
In this regard, we pay a well-deserved tribute to the valuable assistance
given to my country's development efforts by another country from the
developing world the Republic of China whose economic performance, which
now puts it among the major economic Powers of the world, is in many regards
exemplary.","The reunification of China is in essence the sole
concern of the Chinese people. In our opinion, the
international community should turn its attention to the need
to recognize the fundamental rights of the 21 million
inhabitants of the Republic of China.","Like many preceding speakers, I wish to emphasize,
on behalf of Guinea-Bissau, that it is our firm conviction
that the Republic of China in Taiwan should regain its place in the United Nations, on the basis of the principles
of parallel representation of divided countries. As a fullfledged Member of the United Nations, the Republic of
China in Taiwan, with its 20,000,000 inhabitants and its
highly advanced stage of economic and technological
development, could play a preponderant role on the
international scene. We hope that at its next session, which
will coincide with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the founding of our world Organization, the General
Assembly will decide to put this item on its agenda.","As the international community celebrates the fiftieth
anniversary of the establishment of our universal
Organization, may I, on behalf of my Government, reiterate
our firm conviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan
should form part of the United Nations on the basis of the
application of the principle of the parallel representation of
divided countries. In this context, it would be desirable for
the two countries to participate simultaneously in
international activities, with a view to promoting
constructive contacts and negotiations. Respect for and the
exercise of human rights and pluralist democracy are factors in producing national unity and peace, and in
preserving international stability. Guinea-Bissau continues
to endeavour to defend and safeguard this concept, whose
constant application is vital to development.","On behalf of our Government, I reiterate our firm
conviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan should be
part of the United Nations on the basis of respect for the
principle of universality and for the legal equality of States.
The fundamental rights of 21 million inhabitants of a
territory under the jurisdiction of a legal Government whose
President has been democratically elected provide the
political and legal basis for the recognition of their right to
international status as a sovereign State under the legal and
judicial terms enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations.
The reunification of China is a question that must be
resolved by the people of China itself. However, the
Republic of China on Taiwan is legally entitled to enjoy
international status before reunification — in other words,
its recognition as a State and application of the principle of
parallel representation of divided States.","On behalf of our Government, we should also like
to reiterate our conviction that the Republic of China on
Taiwan deserves to regain its rightful place in the United
Nations on the basis of respect for the principle of
universality and the sovereign equality of States. The
Republic of China on Taiwan, a democratic country of
over 20 million people that has made enormous progress
in the economic and social field and with regard to
respect for basic human rights, is today a reality that
cannot be ignored. The readmission of the Republic of China to the United Nations and to all its specialized
agencies would be an important factor for peace, stability
and international cooperation.",,,,,"The Senegalese conflict, in the Casamance
region, provides an example of our resolve to help find
consensus solutions to put an end to many years of
armed conflict in the neighbouring Republic of
Senegal. Respect for the Charter of the Organization of
African Unity as it relates to the retention of the
borders inherited from colonialism calls for GuineaBissau’s participation in efforts to establish peace and
stability in a united and indivisible Senegal.
Based on this conviction, our country supports
the efforts of the People’s Republic of China towards
peaceful reunification, under the theme of “one nation,
two systems.”",,,,,"China is one nation, one people. The People’s
Republic of China’s contribution to the maintenance of

people. ",,,,,,,,,,"We must enhance our relations with the People’s
Republic of China, a country that has been our friend

full solidarity with the People’s Republic of China.",,,
Haiti ,,,,"The fashioning of a new world has been the shared
responsibility of us all since the founding of the
Organization in 1945. At the San Francisco Conference the
Haitian delegation, imbued with the historic responsibility of
being the first black republic in the world, had understood,
above and beyond the inspiration of the day which led to the
establishment of the United Nations, that the Organization
represented an opportunity not only for our island nation but
also for all responsible countries that would join this
community of nations.
We want to take this opportunity to extend a warm
welcome to the new Member States and we hope that the ad
hoc committee which is to study the question of Taiwan will
find a solution that is satisfactory to all the parties
concerned, in keeping with the fundamental principles of
international law.",,,,,"In this context, the envisaged increase in its
membership must take into account more systematically
the principle of equitable geographical distribution. Every
effort must be made to ensure that the universality of all
the planet’s inhabitants is reflected in the United Nations
system.
In this respect, we welcome the dialogue between
the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. A positive
outcome to this dialogue will allow for progress in this
area.","Over the last two months, the Government and the
people of Haiti have observed with sadness and
helplessness the destruction wreaked and the terrible toll
taken by the natural disasters that have struck Turkey,
Taiwan, Greece, the Bahamas and the United States. We
wish to reiterate to the people of these countries that we
share their pain and offer our heartfelt solidarity, having
ourselves, unfortunately, experienced such disasters.
We take this opportunity to repeat that the Haitian
Government is following attentively the evolution of
relations between the two countries on the Taiwan Strait.
Our Government notes with satisfaction that the two sides
are undertaking measures to establish a climate of
confidence, respect and prosperity, which will be of the
utmost benefit to the peoples who live there.","Therefore the situation of the 23 million Chinese
of Taiwan is a matter of concern to us. We welcome the
fact that the dialogue-based approach continues to
prevail on both sides of the Straits of Taiwan. While we
wait for the dialogue to produce satisfactory results for
both sides, we think that the question of the
representation of these 23 million people deserves the
attention of the United Nations.",,"In the same spirit, we appreciate the negotiations
initiated between the two Republics of Korea, and we
are in favour of a rapprochement between the
populations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.",,,,,,,,,,,,"That is why I encourage the United Nations to
continue to support the good relations between the
parties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the
peaceful and constructive approaches to establish
lasting peace in East Asia and the East China Sea.","Similarly, we welcome the signing of the agreement
between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the group of
six countries on the Iranian nuclear issue and the détente
that has resulted from it. I also welcome the atmosphere
of cordiality and fraternal dialogue that now governs
the relations between the People’s Republic of China
and Taiwan. We have no doubt that the new momentum
in their relations will significantly contribute to a muchhoped-for thaw among all the countries of South-East
Asia, moving beyond their differences and divergences.
The Republic of Haiti encourages the spirit of dialogue
prevailing in the relations between nations, which seeks
to reach peaceful solutions to their conflicts.","The Republic of Haiti encourages the international
community to pay further attention to the aspirations
of the Republic of China on Taiwan to play a more
active role in certain decisions and initiatives that
could contribute to stability and reconciliation among
peoples and nations.","The Republic of Haiti, true to its ideals of peace,
dialogue and friendliness among peoples, would very
much like to see a window of opportunity offered
to the Republic of China on Taiwan, so that it can
participate in the major decisions that we, the Member
States, have adopted to improve the human condition
on planet Earth.",,"We must pay greater attention to combating the
various forms of inequality that are continuing to
take root all over the world. These inequalities move
us further and further away from the purposes and
principles of our Organization. Promoting inclusion is
without a doubt one of the fundamental requirements
in the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. Inclusion undoubtedly
implies the participation of all peoples and stakeholders
in making collective efforts to bring about a better
world. With that in mind, the Republic of Haiti wishes to
see greater consideration given to the repeated requests
of the Republic of China, Taiwan, to participate in the
activities of the United Nations system.","While I offer my sincere condolences to the countries that have been greatly
affected by COVID-19, I would like to thank all the partner countries that have
helped the Haitian State to better manage the pandemic, in particular the Republic of
China (Taiwan).
It is time for the world to recognize this nation’s right to exist and afford it its
rightful place in international forums, particularly the United Nations."
Honduras,,,"Moreover, in a world of changing realities, one which is none the less
marked by its attachment to universality and peaceful coexistence, my
Government, like other Central American countries, believes that we should
open the way for the Republic of China, with more than 20 million inhabitants
and authorities established in Taipei, to participate in the work of our
Organization and its specialized agencies as that country does in various
regional forums and international mechanisms. Membership in the United
Nations does not constitute diplomatic recognition of sovereignty, and there
have been and are precedents in the history of the United Nations for the
simultaneous presence of countries which are in search of their historical unity but which, while they remain separated, have not been denied the
opportunity to make their contribution to the complex fabric of international
relations and obligations which bring together the peoples of the Earth
through the United Nations. ",,,,"My delegation wishes once again to place on record its
interest in seeing the Republic of China in Taiwan admitted
as a Member of the United Nations. At this moment in
time, when democratic systems of government and the rule
of law are gaining ground in most of the nations that make
up this Organization, it seems contradictory to continue
excluding the Republic of China in Taiwan from
participation. This is a country which struggled
determinedly for democracy and succeeded in establishing
it this year with the election of a Government by the direct
vote of the majority of its people. This is a nation that
respects human rights, possesses one of the strongest
economies on earth and has been constantly struggling to
eradicate poverty, and whose population of 21 million
people enjoys an enviable cultural level. In short, the
Republic of China in Taiwan fully meets the requirements
established in the Charter for membership of the United
Nations.For the developing countries, its participation in the
various international forums would be extremely beneficial,
since we would be able to draw on its valuable experience
in cooperation programmes, as demonstrated when it
occupied a seat in this General Assembly from the day it
signed the Charter until 1971.
In this respect, my Government supports the resolution
adopted on 19 July 1996 by the European Parliament
entitled the “Role of Taiwan in International
Organizations”, which explicitly states its support for the
idea that the Republic of China in Taiwan should have a
greater level of recognition and representation in
international agencies. It also urges the United Nations to
establish a working group to study the possibility of its","The peoples of the United Nations must be informed
of this important decision. That is why the five Central
American Presidents are here, in this highest world forum,
spreading the good news of this political decision.
Through the representatives here, we wish the world to
learn of this great decision and to accept our aspirations,
which are shared by other regions of the world. In this
context, my country reiterates its endorsement of the right
of the Republic of China to become a Member of the
United Nations family. We support the work of that great
nation, which is seeking ways to participate fully in this and in other international forums without any form of
exclusion or hegemony.","Honduras supports the efforts of the Republic of China
on Taiwan for full membership in the United Nations and
in the international agencies of the United Nations system.
We are convinced that conditions have changed
significantly and that at this time in our history there can be
no justification for the international isolation to which more
than 21 million people are subjected.","The incorporation of three new Members into this
Organization fills us with joy and hope, while inspiring
confidence that the Organization will treat the Republic of
China in the same manner — that, as Taiwan expects, the
new world order will be reflected in greater respect for
the rights and values of Taiwan's inhabitants, including
renewed respect for its aspirations to participate fully in
the greatest human organization on Earth. I do not wish
to miss this opportunity to express the solidarity of the
people of Honduras and of all Central America with the
people of Taiwan as they suffer the terrible misfortune
that is afflicting that sister region of the world.
To summarize, with regard to the new world order,
which we hope will prevail in this global forum,
Honduras supports broader representation of the peoples
and the nations of the world, and a more just and
balanced representation in the discussions and decisions
of the United Nations.","The world of bipolar confrontation is no longer,
and the era of cooperation is under way. Nevertheless,
our Organization is still leaving out States that have
contributed to development, that represent millions of
beings and that participate actively in the world
economy. For these and other reasons, which we have
often cited in this General Assembly and in other
international forums, these States should be
participating in our debates and decisions. One such
State is the Republic of China.","At this juncture the Organization should continue
and expand its leadership and allow all peaceful
international players, including the Republic of China
on Taiwan, to participate in the joint combat against the
renewed threats to peace, security and the welfare of all
nations. All of this applies to the international arena.","The time has come to join in our resolve to seek
mechanisms and decisions that will secure the full
participation of all the peoples and nations of the Earth.
It is time for those who have been Members of the
Organization to return. For that reason, Honduras
believes that we should not continue the practice of
excluding from our debates and our work concrete
realities such as Taiwan, a country whose participation
could offer new opportunities for cooperation for the
benefit of many peoples, and which, in turn could
benefit from our activity and decisions.",,,,,"We express solidarity with peoples who are
fighting for their identity, and reaffirm our support for
the Republic of Taiwan in its efforts to achieve
recognition in this forum of nations, in its fight for
independence, and in its constructive and faithful
dedication to the many development processes under
way in Central American countries. ",Yes,,"Productive programmes, such as the United States
Millennium Challenge Corporation in Honduras, have

condolences and sympathy to those who have suffered from
the disaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan renounced territorial sovereignty over the
island of Formosa — Taiwan — and the Pescadores,
ceded by China after the Sino-Japanese war, in
accordance with article 2 (b) of the San Francisco
Peace Treaty. It was made clear, however, that the
Senkaku Islands were not included with Formosa
and the Pescadores, by the fact that the United States of America actually exercised administrative rights
over the Senkaku Islands, as part of the Nansei Shoto
southwest islands, in accordance with article 3 of the
Peace Treaty, and the islands were explicitly included
in the areas whose administrative rights reverted to
Japan in 1972.
It was only in the 1970s that the Government of
China and the Taiwanese authorities began making
their own assertions of territorial sovereignty over the
Senkaku Islands, which are part of Japan’s inherent
territory. Until then they had never expressed any
objections to Japan, nor did they protest the fact that the
islands were included in the area over which the United
States exercised administrative rights in accordance
with article 3 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The
posture of simply attributing this difference of opinion
between the two countries to the past war is not just
unconvincing and unproductive; it is also a way to
evade the essence of the issue.",,,,,,,,
Kiribati,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We attach great importance to our membership in
this noble Organization, and we reaffirm our
commitment to upholding the noble values and
principles enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations. The Charter epitomizes our hope for
achieving justice and equality and the safeguarding and
promotion of fundamental human rights of all peoples.
Within that context, we believe that the exclusionary
principles applied to Taiwan in its bid for United
Nations membership go against the very values and
objectives of the Charter that we all strive to uphold. In
this era of tension and conflict we should discard the
present exclusionary practices and adopt a more
embracing environment where all countries willing and
able to contribute to the international community’s
efforts to promote world peace and stability are
welcomed as equal partners. Taiwan has made and
continues to make notable contributions to the
development of many developing countries and has the
capacity to contribute constructively to the good work
of the United Nations. It is therefore regrettable that
the desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to again
become a part of that global community of nations
continues to be rejected.","As we consider reform of the United Nations and
as we celebrate 60 years of the United Nations, we
believe that now is also the time to consider the issue
of Taiwan and its 23 million people. Taiwan is a
country where democracy thrives, where the rule of
law prevails and where human rights are respected.
Taiwan has also remained able and willing to make
significant contributions to the collaborative efforts to
secure global peace, security and prosperity.
We also believe that, whatever the views are on
the question of whether Taiwan is a domestic issue or
not, there can be no justification for supporting
threatening initiatives, such as the so called antisecession law, which could have such far-reaching
effects on regional and global stability.","Therefore, I note with much disappointment and
regret that the desire of the 23 million people of
Taiwan to join this Organization of ours continues to
be rejected, despite Taiwan’s demonstrated ability,
willingness and commitment to contribute to
international collaborative efforts in the pursuit of
global peace and security. In recent years, there has
been much talk of good governance, of democratizing nations. Should we not also talk about adopting a
policy of good governance in our multilateral
organizations? Should we also not talk about
democratizing our multilateral organizations? We
deplore the sad state of affairs in which a nation of 23
million people is deliberately exempt from
participation as an equal member of the international
community. ","This time last year, Kiribati joined other States
Members of the United Nations in expressing our
disappointment over the continued neglect and
rejection of the desire of the 23 million people of
Taiwan to join this Organization. It is further saddening
to note that Taiwan’s request for admission this year
was again not given a fair opportunity to be heard by
the General Assembly.
 With a population of 23 million, giving it the
forty-seventh largest population in the world, Taiwan
has continued to respect and abide by the United
Nations Charter based on the principles of democracy,
mutual respect and understanding. We feel that Taiwan
and its 23 million people deserve justice from this
noble institution. It is Kiribati’s fervent hope that
Taiwan will one day be given the nod to assume its
rightful place in this highly respected Organization. ","While we commend the United Nations for the
many initiatives put forward in addressing the needs of
its Members, it is regrettable that it has continued to
deny the 23 million people of Taiwan equal rights as
international citizens to participate fully in world
affairs. We believe that Taiwan has made an active
contribution that has enriched the lives of many in their
collaborative efforts in building and securing
international peace and security. We believe that the
people of Taiwan should be accorded the same
fundamental right to participate as fellow citizens of
the international community and to be allowed to
contribute meaningfully in various sectors of the
Organization’s activities. ","On the issue of global governance, the United
Nations is undergoing change to adapt to the realities
of our time. It must maintain its relevance if it is to
address the security challenges that the world continues
to face. We believe that the United Nations should be
an inclusive Organization, particularly for States such
as Taiwan that make a contribution to world harmony
and have demonstrated time and again their willingness
and ability to contribute positively to international
cooperative efforts. Taiwan has demonstrated its
commitment to international peace and security
through its contributions to national, regional and
international development programmes. It is only fair
and fitting, therefore, that Taiwan should be allowed to participate meaningfully in meetings and activities of
the United Nations organs. Given the impact of climate
change and the demands of aviation safety and security
on its development and the well-being of its people, we
now appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan
in the work and activities of the International Civil
Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. ","It is gratifying to note the easing of tensions and
improvement of relations across the Taiwan Straits —
no doubt, a most welcome development for all in that region. We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the
World Health Assembly, and we hope that similar
understanding will prevail in respect of other
international institutions in which Taiwan can
participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of
humanity. ","In the same vein, we believe that all nations and
peoples — including Taiwan — that play a role in
international affairs, including contributing to climate
change, should also be part of the solution. During
these difficult times, and facing challenges to our
existing world order, we can ill afford to isolate any
nation that has the capacity to assist in our struggles. ","It is gratifying to note the continued easing of
tension and the improvement of relations across the
Taiwan Straits. We also welcome the inclusion of
countries such as Taiwan in the international activities
of the World Health Assembly. We hope that a
similar understanding will prevail in respect of other
international institutions and processes so that Taiwan
can participate and contribute meaningfully for the
good of humanity.","We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the
international processes of the World Health Assembly.
We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in
respect of other international institutions and processes,
so that Taiwan, and others currently excluded, can
participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of
humankind.","We welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the
international processes of the World Health Assembly.
We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail
in respect of our other international institutions and the
United Nations processes, where Taiwan and all those
that can participate and contribute meaningfully for the
good of humankind can be brought in to do so.","We welcome the inclusive approach taken in
developing the post-2015 development agenda. We
also welcome the participation of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly — for example, its inclusion in the
fight against Ebola — and we would like to see a
similar inclusive approach prevail in respect of other
international institutions and United Nations processes
in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals
and in the call for urgent climate action, where Taiwan
and all who can participate and contribute meaningfully
for the good of humankind must be brought in to do so.
Everyone needs to be brought in...But we cannot do it alone. There needs to be a
collective global effort. We call for new and accessible
financial resources to assist the most vulnerable to adapt
and build resilience to climate change. We welcome the
continued assistance of our partners, including Taiwan,
but much, much more needs to be done. While it is
commendable that there have been significant pledges
for the Green Climate Fund, there remain the challenge
of accessibility and the translation of these pledges into
contributions where they matter the most. We welcome
the assistance provided by various agencies with the
capacity to provide the needed conduit, but it is equally
important that such assistance not get eroded in the
process.","It is troubling to note that for years, indeed decades,
our global family has often ignored the support and
instrumental role of those who have contributed to
the implementation of our sustainable development
goals. As some of us would acknowledge, Taiwan
has served as a significant partner and contributed
significantly to achieving the objectives of our global
family. This must be acknowledged and the increased
and meaningful participation of Taiwan in international
processes should be encouraged. We need our global
transformation to include those who can contribute to
the effective implementation of the SDGs.","We cannot talk about focusing on people and
creating a decent life for all if our United Nations family
is incomplete or unbalanced. Every year, we pledge to
consolidate and act together to provide a better life
for our people, yet we choose to ignore the 23 million
people in Taiwan and deprive them of the right to be part
of this global family and to participate and contribute
meaningfully to the sustainable development agenda.
We call for a reform programme that will see Taiwan
included in our global family’s efforts and drive to
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.","The United Nations theme to be delivered in the next
12 months is about all the people living on this planet.
That theme will be irrelevant if the United Nations
continues to ignore the 20 million people who live and
contribute to our shared home and to exclude them from
the process. We are one family, and we therefore call for
an inclusive approach enabling Taiwan to participate in
international processes and to contribute to addressing
areas of concern to this United Nations organ, including
the implementation of the SDGs.",,
Latvia,,,"In international relations there exist problems of yet a different
nature, problems related to the unification of nations as well as to the
representation in the world community of sovereign parts of a divided nation.
The Government of the Republic of China in Taiwan has been created by the
tides of history. In our opinion, the international community has been unfair
in ignoring this fact. Does not international experience bear evidence that
participation in the international community by two sovereign parts of one
nation provides an opportunity for a productive dialogue between these parts?
The United Nations must pay attention to the problems of both large and
small States. In our opinion, the security of small States should be a
central concern of the Organization, since there does not exist a balance of
power or agreement on goals between small States and their larger neighbours
at this time.
In my opinion, when discussing the relationships between nations, one
must remember that there are neither great nor small nations. A nation is

Republic of China and the Republic of China on
either side of the Taiwan Strait constitutes for my
country, a founding Member of the Organization,
one of the difficulties and the source of the prevalent
sense of frustration that continue to persist on the
international political scene since the end of the cold
war.
“It really begs the issue to review the decision
of the General Assembly on 25 October 1971, when
its Members voted to admit the People’s Republic of
China to membership while ignoring a compromise
proposal that the Republic of China retain a seat in

supporter of the principle of including every nation
in the United Nations system, feels that there should
be a re-examination of the proposal to which I have
just referred, with a view to admitting the Republic
of China to the General Assembly. Quite clearly,
existing global realities make it necessary and
prudent for us to review the action taken in 1971.
We believe that the United Nations is the proper
instrument for the correction of many seemingly
intractable problems. We would add that this
Organization is the most significant international
forum for the resolution of complex crises and that
all nations that desire to participate in the United
Nations should have that right. Yet, in the highest
sense, we believe that until reunification is achieved

examined with a view to the unification of the Chinese
people based on their own will and decision. However,
we also believe that it is the responsibility of this
Organization to provide the impetus for the unification of
the two Chinas. History is replete with examples of the
membership in this Organization of divided countries,
where unification was peacefully settled under the aegis
of the United Nations. We have confidence in the ability
of the United Nations to allow history to be repeated on
a similar matter of grave importance to this Organization.
In the interest of equity and the maintenance of regional
peace and security, my country calls for the parallel
representation in the United Nations of the People’s
Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.","Liberia firmly believes that the unification of China
should be peacefully pursued and that although it is a
matter for the Chinese people themselves to determine,
there is nonetheless a need for the United Nations to
examine the exceptional international situation pertaining
to the Republic of China on Taiwan. In so doing it will
ensure that the fundamental rights of 22 million people to
participate in the work and activities of the United
Nations, and it will do honour to this great world body.
The Republic of China on Taiwan has contributed
substantially to the international community in the area of
technical and development assistance and has shown a
strong commitment to human rights, democracy, market
economy and multilateralism. The unparalleled economic
and political development of the Republic of China on
Taiwan has brought a strong desire of its people to
participate in international activities.
Resolution 2758 (XXVI), however, denies over 22
million people their right to participate in United Nations
activities and contravenes the United Nations Charter's
principle of universality. Taking into account the changing
international climate, characterized by global economic
interdependence, it is essential for the United Nations to
review this unfair resolution as it steps into a new
century. Liberia believes that the Republic of China on
Taiwan can play a more important and beneficial role in
the United Nations community and that it is willing to
play that role. Liberia strongly urges the United Nations
to find a speedy and satisfactory resolution to the
Republic of China on Taiwan's participation in the United
Nations.","General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) denies
the Taiwanese people the right to participate in United
Nations activities and contravenes the United Nations
Charter’s principle of universality. How can such
injustice suffice in this era of increased global
interaction, economic interdependence, political
transformation, democratization and rapprochement?
With the undeniable record of the Republic of
China, its experience in democracy as proven by the
recent election of President Chen Shui-bian, its respect
for human rights, its economic power resulting from its
acceptance of the market economy; the energy,
imagination and courage of its people; technological
achievements and humanitarian attributes all over the
world, who would query its overarching relevance?
Liberia fervently reiterates its call for the
inclusion of the Republic of China in this world
Organization. We believe that the Republic of China can make important contributions that would serve the
best interests of the United Nations community.","At the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations
General Assembly, in 1971, a major decision was taken that to date has had far reaching implications. On 25
October of that year, after two decades of debate, by
virtue of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI)
adopted by a vote of 76 in favour, 36 against and 17
abstentions) the Republic of China was expelled from
the world body. By that decision, a founding Member
and its population — at that time of 14 million
people — were effectively prevented from associating
with the rest of the world. Nothing in the Charter
justified such a decision, yet a precedent was set that is
still unsurpassed. Nevertheless, it is the conviction of
the Liberian Government that the now 23 million
peace-loving people of the Republic of China should be
allowed representation and participation in our world
body. It is also the hope of the Liberian people that the
great Chinese people will one day be peacefully
reunited under the principles of democracy and human
rights.","The consistent denial of the United Nations to
admit the Republic of China on Taiwan into this world
body is a violation of Article 4 of the Charter, which
specifically states that
“Membership in the United Nations is open
to all other peace-loving States which accept the
obligations contained in the present Charter and,
in the judgement of the Organization, are able and
willing to carry out these obligations.”
The 23 million peace-loving people of the
Republic of China deserve to be represented in the
United Nations. They have demonstrated their capacity
and willingness fully to live up to the obligations of
States Members of the United Nations, as they have
demonstrated in other world bodies. It is therefore the
conviction of the Liberian Government that the
Republic of China should be allowed representation
and participation in this world body. The Liberian
Government continues to hold the view that it is the Chinese people themselves, under the principles of
democracy and of respect for human rights, who will
one day resolve the question of Chinese reunification.
Liberia encourages the continuation of the cross-straits
dialogue in the interest of the greater good of the
Chinese people.","I should now like to turn to the case of the
Republic of China. The General Assembly must
confront the moral and legal challenges posed by the
exclusion of more than 23 million people from
representation in this world body. How else are we to
explain the denial of the rights of a progressive and
industrious people from representation at the level of
the General Assembly? The fact remains that the
Government and people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan have, and continue to engage in, responsible
self-governance. It is incontestable that the people of
the Republic of China on Taiwan continue to
significantly contribute to the improvement of the
human family. Their achievements in the spheres of
science and technology, commerce and trade, and the
arts and culture cannot be ignored.
The undaunted spirit of the great people of the
Republic of China aspires to participate in the United
Nations. Liberia is convinced that the participation of
both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the activities of
international organizations will encourage greater
understanding and mutual trust between the two sides.
That is consistent with the spirit of preventive
diplomacy advocated by the United Nations. Liberia
therefore reiterates its call for the admission of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations and
its specialized agencies, as well as the assumption of
its rightful place in the discourse and transaction of
world affairs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Macedonia,,,,,,,,,,"On this occasion, I would like to express my deepest
condolences to the people of Taiwan on the earthquake that
hit the Republic of China on Taiwan, with which the
Republic of Macedonia has recently established diplomatic
relations.","One of the main characteristics of the modern
world is that now more than ever there is a great deal
of interdependence. This represents a new challenge,
and at the same time is a new feature of international
relations. Moreover, when everybody is talking about
the enormous significance of the ever more important
multilateral character of the international scene and
about globalization, the question of the equal
participation of all the world’s actors is being raised.
That is, at issue is the official representation of the
voices of all peoples. In this regard, I would like to
express our support for the efforts of the Republic of
China on Taiwan to become integrated into the
international community, taking into consideration the
interests of that country and also its significant
contribution to international cooperation and the
solidarity it has shown. It is in the interest of our
Organization that the 23 million people of the Republic
of China participate in its activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Malawi,,,,"The PLO/Israel peace agreement is yet another
demonstration of the dramatic changes in international
relations that have taken place in the last three to four years,
following the collapse of communism and the end of the
cold war. It is in this context, that my Government is
optimistic that the still unresolved major international
political issues will be similarly dealt with, issues such as the problem of North and South Korea and that of the
People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China on
Taiwan. In the view of the Malawi delegation, the time has
now come for serious consideration to be given to the
eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a
Member of the United Nations. We cannot talk about
human rights and the universality of the United Nations
while in the same breath ignoring the existence of over 20
million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan.","My Government has followed with equally keen
interest developments in other regions of the world. We
have been encouraged by the quickened tempo of the peace
process in the Middle East, as well as by the flame of hope,
albeit flickering, kindled by the first serious dialogue
between the parties to the political deadlock over the
Korean Peninsula. It is my Government’s hope that the
dialogue that has been going on between the People’s
Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan
will lead to a solution that is mutually satisfactory to the
parties concerned.","In the same vein, my Government favours any
efforts the United Nations may undertake with the aim of
resolving the issue of the international status of the
Republic of China on Taiwan in a manner which would
be acceptable to both the Government of the People’s
Republic of China and the authorities in Taiwan.","It is the wish of my Government that the longstanding question of the international status of the
Republic of China on Taiwan will be peacefully resolved
in a manner acceptable to the Governments on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait. We are encouraged by the recent
reported indications that the two sides are ready to talk to
each other. However, the Malawi Government wishes to
reaffirm its commitment to the promotion of freedom,
human rights and democratic principles and therefore
supports the aspirations of the more than 21 million
Taiwanese people to recognition and full participation in
all the activities of the international community.",,"One of the major issues for the United Nations is the
concern for national identity. In this century nations have
been born. Great nations have disintegrated, while others
have found new solutions and come back together. It is in
this spirit of helping the powers of healing that Malawi
stands to reiterate its conviction that the question of the
participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
activities of the United Nations on the basis of respect for
the principle of universality and the sovereign equality of
States deserves consideration. Malawi believes that
appropriate participation by the Republic of China on
Taiwan in the international community would be an
important factor for peace, stability and international
cooperation in that part of the world.","One of the major issues on which people look up to
the United Nations is because of its concern for national
identity. It is in this spirit that Malawi reiterates its
conviction that the question of participation by the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the
United Nations deserves consideration on the basis of
respect for the principle of universality and the sovereign
equality of States. The Republic of China, a democratic
country of over 21 million people, is a reality and cannot
be ignored. It cannot be wished away. Malawi believes
that readmission of the Republic of China to the United
Nations and to all its specialized agencies would be an
important factor for peace, stability and international
cooperation.","Time and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of
granting the Republic of China on Taiwan the role that
it deserves in the international community. The hardworking and peace-loving people of Taiwan have
clearly demonstrated that they are ready to actively
contribute to the goals and ideals for which the United
Nations stands.
We therefore appeal to the Organization’s
membership to look beyond narrow political
considerations and face the geopolitical realities that
obtain on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The
continued isolation of Taiwan does not bode well for
the spirit of globalization, which we all acknowledge,
has to be all-inclusive.","Time and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of
readmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
United Nations membership, which would grant to that
country a well-deserved opportunity for active
engagement in international affairs. Malawi finds it
grossly unjust that the hard-working and peace-loving
people of Taiwan should suffer diplomatic isolation so
unnecessarily. Therefore, Malawi would like to appeal
to the entire United Nations membership to look
beyond narrow political considerations and face up to
the geopolitical and economic realities that obtain on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The diplomatic
isolation of Taiwan remains both a curiosity and a
contradiction in terms. First, almost every country
deals with Taiwan in terms of trade and other forms of
bilateral cooperation. Secondly, the isolation of Taiwan
violates its people’s inalienable right to free association
within the framework of the United Nations Charter","Malawi believes in the principle of universality of
human rights. One of the basic rights that every
member of the global community can expect to enjoy is
the right to freedom of association. It is on the basis of
that, and in a spirit of reconciliation, that Malawi
believes that the United Nations should seriously
reconsider the question of the readmission of the
Republic of China. The more than 21 million people of
Taiwan should be allowed to freely participate in the
affairs of the United Nations without any hindrance, as
that is what this Organization stands for. After all,
Taiwan, through its rapid growth in the economic,
political and social sectors has demonstrated that it has
a lot to offer for the good of humanity through the
United Nations.","Malawi believes that the United Nations can
meaningfully advance the principles upon which it was
founded and effectively deal with the multiple
challenges that the global community is facing by
taking an all-inclusive approach to its membership. It is
in this spirit that my country has, time and again, called
for the participation of the Republic of China in the
affairs of this Organization in line with the principle of
universality. Taiwan has a lot to offer in the promotion
of the global common good, which the United Nations
is here to advance. I therefore hope that the 23 million
people of Taiwan will be given sympathetic
consideration so that they may, once again, enjoy the
right to associate with the world community through
this Organization.",,"That is why we in Malawi call for the admission
of the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of the
United Nations. That request is made on the premise
that, following the collapse of communism in Eastern
Europe and in the Soviet Union, the new States that
emerged therefrom expressed their desire to become
sovereign and independent Members of the United
Nations. They were granted membership. That was a
political decision. In the same way, when the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up into the
separate States of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia, each
State was admitted into the United Nations. That also
was a political decision. Czechoslovakia broke up into
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and each of those
States was admitted into the United Nations. In SouthEast Asia, Singapore pulled out of the Federation of
Malaya and became a Member of the United Nations.
Later, East Timor broke away from Indonesia and was
also admitted as a Member. Those were political
decisions.
The Government of Malawi is therefore puzzled
that the Republic of China (Taiwan), which took a
similar political decision, is denied membership in the
United Nations. How can the United Nations stand for
equity and justice when it is denying membership to
more than 23 million people who contribute
significantly to global trade and development? How
can the United Nations justify its denial of membership
to Taiwan when, in fact, the countries listed above
were admitted? Why is Taiwan being discriminated
against in the United Nations? Unless those questions are honestly answered,
observers will conclude that the United Nations is
applying a double standard. The Government of
Malawi believes that the United Nations should use the
same standard to grant membership to the Republic of
China. I therefore appeal to the United Nations,
through you, Mr. President, to extend membership to
the Taiwanese people in the same way as it has done
for countries of Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.
That would enable the dynamic and resourceful people
of Taiwan to play their rightful role in global affairs,
industrialization, trade and development. I believe that
the admission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) into
the United Nations would also bring credibility to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","The second issue that is germane to global
partnership is for me to reiterate my plea for the
readmission of the Republic of China – Taiwan — as a
Member of the United Nations. Many of those present
will agree that since the end of the cold war, and with
the advent of globalization, Taiwan has quietly
contributed to the work of the United Nations and its
specialized agencies in various areas, including
technology, medicine, research, industry and
international trade. That contribution becomes
increasingly important, especially within the principle
of universality, equity and justice. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Malta ,,,,,,,,,,"Even our best efforts can be brought to nothing in an
instant, by the sheer force of nature. The recent
devastating earthquakes that hit the peoples of Turkey,
Greece and Taiwan have galvanized the international
community. Shocked by the loss of so many lives, the
displacement of whole communities and the pain of
thousands, the international response to alleviate the
suffering was generous and expeditious. It was yet
another instance where the expression of solidarity
towards the victims of a natural disaster unveiled the
human face of the international community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marshall Islands,,,,,,,,,,"As a small but determined democracy, the Marshall
Islands supported the inclusion of the agenda item on the
need to examine the exceptional international situation
pertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan and ensure
that the fundamental right of its 22 million people to
participate in the work and activities of the United Nations
is fully respected. We hope to achieve a resolution of this
matter in the near future. There is still a need for an ad hoc
committee to be established to examine the matter further.","On the other hand, the denial of membership in
this Organization to the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, who have made a
significant and meaningful contribution to international
development, is contrary not only to the true spirit of
the United Nations Charter, but also to its principle of
universality and to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. We must strengthen the vital role of the
Organization in achieving the goals of conflict
prevention, maintenance of peace, regional stability,
promotion of fundamental human rights and
development of democracy and international progress,
and in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples to selfdetermination and engagement, because the United
Nations is the only Organization that can bring that
shining light to those 23 million people. Furthermore,
the United Nations is the only forum for Member
States to build mutual trust and to resolve issues
through peaceful dialogue. The guiding principles of
democracy, respect for human rights and the right of
peoples to self-determination must, in conformity with
the principles of justice and international law, continue
to underpin our collective aspirations. This will require
our concerted action in this new millennium.","The exclusion from this body and its related
agencies of the Republic of China on Taiwan is a
major, serious hindrance to the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan in its pursuit of its
fundamental rights to participate in international
dialogue and regional organizations and activities. The
time has come once again to reconsider the exclusion
of the Republic of China on Taiwan from this
prestigious body. There is so much that the Republic of
China on Taiwan could do, in cooperation with the
United Nations system, in the areas of sustainable
development, technology, health, peace and prosperity.","Among the most important challenges faced by
this body is the continued exclusion of the Republic of
China on Taiwan from the United Nations. The
Marshall Islands Government reiterates its concern that
the exclusion of a nation of peaceful and law-abiding
citizens is not consistent with the inclusive ideal of the
United Nations. I therefore urge each and every one of
you, all of us, to overcome our biases and to allow the
admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the
United Nations.","Another important issue facing this body is the
continued exclusion of the Republic of China on
Taiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands
Government reiterates its concern that the exclusion of
a nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not
consistent with the inclusive ideal of the United
Nations. I therefore strongly urge every Member State
to reconsider this matter.","Another issue requiring action by this body is the
continued exclusion of Taiwan from the United
Nations. Taiwan is a peace-loving, sovereign State, and
only its democratically elected Government can be the
legitimate representative of the interests of the people
of Taiwan within the United Nations. The Marshall
Islands reiterates its full support for the ongoing quest
of the people of Taiwan to be granted membership in
this global body and in various other international
organizations.","Bearing in mind the phrase ìwe the peoplesî in
the Preamble to the Charter, Marshall Islands believes
that if the United Nations adheres to the principles of
universality and self-determination, it must not exclude
the 23 million people of the free, democratic and
independent nation of Taiwan. As a free and
prosperous country, Taiwan has much to contribute to
the peace and security of the Western Pacific, and we
reiterate our full support for the ongoing quest of the
people of Taiwan to be granted membership in this
family of nations. Denying membership to a free and
democratic nation and condoning the presence of
repressive States is a flagrant violation of basic
democratic principles.","We also call on the United Nations to admit the
23 million citizens of Taiwan to the United Nations
family. Taiwan, which shares the Organization’s view
on the principles of universality and selfdetermination, has been enjoying a democratic
Government of its own for over half a century. The fact
that Taiwan has been denied membership into the
United Nations again and again questions the
legitimacy of the Organization. On behalf of my
country, I therefore urge this body to welcome Taiwan
into its membership. ","However, while the United Nations continues to
work with States in resolving disputes peacefully and
in helping to create democratic societies, it still turns a
blind eye to the 23 million people of Taiwan and
silences their voices. The absence of Taiwan in the
United Nations creates a gap in the global network for
cooperation, goes against the ideals and concept of
justice upheld by the United Nations and contravenes
the principle of universality. ","Recent positive developments, evidenced by the
easing of tension and the improvement of relations
between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan have begun a new era of good will and hope for
improved economic possibilities and political stability.
In the context of those emerging dynamics now
maturing between China and Taiwan, we see evidence
of a mutual desire for dialogue and engagement in a
process that can forge better relations and
understanding. It is a development worthy of our
respect, and it presents an excellent opportunity for the
international community to encourage and strengthen
that process. ","The increasing complexity of the management of
evolving global affairs demands a reconstitution of the
membership of the Security Council. Japan’s
distinguished leadership and achievements in the area
of human security match its aspirations to seek a
permanent seat on the Council and thus deserve
favourable consideration. Evidence of progress in the
confidence-building process between China and the
Republic of China (Taiwan) deserves praise and
encouragement from the international community.
Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations
specialized agencies will enable its 23 million people
to play an active part in the affairs of the family of
nations. ","The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes
the progress achieved on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits. The pragmatic and moderate actions of Taiwan
should not be overlooked by the United Nations, and
deserve further encouragement. I call upon the United
Nations system and Member States to be open-minded
and identify appropriate means to accept Taiwan’s
participation within specialized agencies, including the
International Civil Aviation Organization, and in the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. In particular, recognizing the commitment to
reduce emissions by the 23 million people of
Taiwan — a fellow island nation — in addressing
climate change is in the common interest of us all. ","As a significant global economic leader, Taiwan
can make substantial contributions to the international
community. The Republic of the Marshall Islands
welcomes increased dialogue on key cross-Strait
issues. That progress deserves recognition by the
international community. Given that the primary
purpose of the United Nations is to maintain
international peace, the world cannot afford to
overlook Taiwan’s strong efforts in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including with
regard to climate change.
 The 2009 invitation by the World Health
Organization for Taiwan to participate as an observer
has not only benefited global medical progress,
including on non-communicable diseases, but also
serves as an effective model for its wider participation
in other key organizations. We urge the United Nations
and its Member States to consider that model and
develop effective means for Taiwan’s participation in
specialized agencies, including the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
International Civil Aviation Organization. ","The United Nations cannot fail the needs of the most
vulnerable nations and must better harness the efforts
of all necessary actors. The Marshall Islands urges
other nations to facilitate the meaningful participation
of Taiwan within the United Nations system and the
international community. Taiwan should be able to
participate as an observer in the UNFCCC and the
International Civil Aviation Organization, as it does
in the World Health Assembly, and its potential for
meeting the MDGs should be recognized.","My Government is gratified to note
that — with solid international support and crossstrait cooperation — the Republic of China on Taiwan
has increased its meaningful participation in United
Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will
continue to encourage positive interaction between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.","Everyone should participate on the international
stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations
specialized agencies and mechanisms, including
the World Health Organization, the International
Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well
as in key regional economic integration mechanisms.
Furthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the
post-2015 development agenda and urge recognition
of the important assistance provided to my country
in health, education and energy. The Marshall Islands
welcomes Taiwan’s efforts to reduce cross-Strait
tensions and urges States Members of the United
Nations to recognize and encourage such progress.","Everyone should participate on the international
stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized
agencies of the United Nations, including the World
Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the UNFCCC. It is imperative that
the global community fully recognize and evaluate
Taiwan’s important commitment to reduce its emissions.
Furthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the
implementation of the post-2015 development agenda,
and urge recognition of the important assistance it has
provided to my country in the areas of health, education
and energy. The Marshall Islands welcomes Taiwan’s
efforts as a regional peacemaker, including in cross strait issues, and urges that States Members of the
United Nations recognize and encourage such progress. ","I have spent most of my speech today urging that
no one be left behind and demonstrating our goodwill
to play our part. I must also emphasize that the role
of Taiwan as a key stakeholder and its determination
to contribute to global affairs should be better
recognized. I call on the international community to
support Taiwan’s efforts as an advocate for regional and
global stability, peace and dialogue, including in crossStrait relations. The United Nations should be more
committed to ensuring Taiwan’s fundamental right
to participate in mechanisms, meetings and activities
of the specialized agencies of the United Nations
system, and Taiwan should be recognized for its strong contribution in working with us and others towards
achieving the SDGs.","No one is to be left behind when it comes to the
SDGs or to complying with the Charter of the United
Nations. Therefore, we should consider that the
exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations and its
related agencies has created major challenges for both
the Government and the people of Taiwan in the pursuit
of their fundamental right to participate. As is the case
for my nation, Taiwan is an indispensable partner for
the international community, including for our own
receipt of humanitarian aid, medical assistance, disease
prevention, environmental protection, anti-terrorism
and transnational-crime prevention. Practical
approaches could allow us to work through existing
controversies in order to achieve the global benefits of
universal participation, including in the International
Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
World Health Organization.
Security Council resolution 2758 (1971) has been
misused to justify the people of Taiwan’s exclusion
from the United Nations. As a result, we are missing
an important opportunity to cooperate with a proactive
contributor to peace and the common global good. The
United Nations, I believe, can and must do better.","The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports the
recognition of Taiwan’s meaningful participation within
the United Nations system, including programmes
and agencies such as the International Civil Aviation
Organization, the World Health Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The people of Taiwan deserve equal treatment,
and the United Nations should resolve the serious issue
of the exclusion of Taiwan’s 23 million people from the
United Nations system, an issue that we believe is not
addressed in resolution 2758 (XXVI).
Taiwan has been implementing the Sustainable
Development Goals and has released a voluntary
national review. It has the capacity to contribute to
a wide range of United Nations programmes that are
relevant to global progress. Diseases such as tuberculosis
know no boundaries, and Taiwan has brought its
policy framework in line with global efforts. Taiwan
has served as a primary partner of my own nation in
addressing non-communicable diseases, which are now
at crisis levels. Blocking Taiwan’s participation does
not benefit global human welfare.","The Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly
affirms its close relationship with Taiwan. The
lasting friendship between our free and democratic
nations is truly unstoppable. Indeed, this past month
our Parliament strengthened those ties through a
unanimous resolution. Further, Taiwan should play a
clear role within the United Nations system that includes
meaningful participation in the relevant specialized
agencies and mechanisms, such as the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World
Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation
Organization. If we as a world and the United Nations
are truly serious about leaving no one behind, we
should recognize the participation and assistance of
all relevant sources, and thus appropriately recognize Taiwan’s partnership and engagement with my own
nation and others.","The world cannot simply ignore Taiwan, as I can assure it in fact exists, and we
must have open minds to ensure the 23 million people of Taiwan are not left behind,
nor their humanitarian contributions taken for granted. Taiwan should be allowed to
participate in an equal and dignified manner within the UN system, including the
WHO, ICAO and the UNFCCC, as well as activities related to the SDGs. The vital civic space of UN premises should be opened for visits and attendance of meetings
as well as for the media, regardless of origin."

no doubt that the condition that unification should take

and the rest of that region. Peace and security in the
Taiwan Strait is peace and security in the Asia-Pacific
region. I am very hopeful that Member States will
recognize and accept the appeal by the good people of
Taiwan at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. ","Despite this Organization’s pledge for
universality and the protection of human rights for all,
we still deny the 23 million people of Taiwan their
right to peace and to development without threat of
attack, including through the denial of their right to
representation at the United Nations. We support the inclusivity of the United Nations,
and we reject threats to human dignity, including the
denial that the Holocaust ever occurred, together with
any call for the elimination of any responsible Member
State of this Organization.
 That is why Nauru will join other Member
countries in protesting and seeking legal redress to the
violations of the rules of procedure of the General
Assembly that occurred during the meeting of the
General Committee last week. Two questions were to
be debated: a proactive role for the United Nations in
maintaining peace and security in East Asia, and the
question of the representation and participation of the
23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations.  ","This Organization prides itself on being inclusive
and on being a champion to everyone; yet my
delegation is extremely disappointed that, despite the
efforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause, the
United Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish of Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a
member of this Organization.
 On the 19 July this year, an application for
membership to the United Nations was delivered to the
Office of the Secretary-General, signed by the
democratically elected President of Taiwan, His
Excellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately, the United
Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the
Security Council were then contravened. Owing to
poor legal advice, the Office of the Secretary-General
failed to forward Taiwan’s application for membership
to the Security Council, citing General Assembly
resolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though
many Member States continue to hide behind
resolution 2758 (XXVI), it should be realized that this
resolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the
People’s Republic of China, nor does it preclude
Taiwan from future membership of this body. It
certainly does not support the so-called one China
principle.
 Ever since the establishment of the People’s
Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with
neither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over
the other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no
intention of representing the People’s Republic of
China. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign
State, and its democratically elected Government is the
sole legitimate Government of their island State.
 Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan
to be part of the United Nations, there is another
dimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan
is one of the largest economies in the world, including
being one of the larger trading partners of other
Members of the United Nations. It is also one of the
top twenty sources of world foreign investment and is
well positioned to assist many of the members of this
body in their development, which it has already
demonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and
trading partner for my country and others in my
region — even for those that do not recognize it
formally.
 My delegation calls on the Office of the
Secretary-General to uphold the integrity of this preeminent Organization and conform to the United
Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the
Security Council. It must immediately accept and submit to the Security Council Taiwan’s application for
membership. ","If the United Nations prides itself on being an
inclusive Organization that champions the rights of
everyone, it cannot continue to deny the fundamental
right of Taiwan’s 23 million people to participate in the
specialized agencies of the United Nations. It is clear
to all of us that cross-Strait relations have been
improving since May 2008 and that leaders from both
sides have openly shown a willingness to work
together to create a positive atmosphere. It is now time
for the United Nations to find a solution to the
exclusion of Taiwan. Only by allowing Taiwan to
participate meaningfully in the specialized agencies of
the United Nations can the principle of universality and
democratization of the Organization be fulfilled, and
regional peace and prosperity ensured. ","Climate change calls for the widest possible
cooperation from every member of the international
community. Taiwan, as one of the world’s 20 largest
economies, can contribute in many ways and should be
invited to play a larger role in the United Nations
system, particularly in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change process. Taiwan has
much to offer to vulnerable countries, especially in
adaptation measures, technology transfer and
financingThe challenges of the new millennium can be
overcome only through multilateral cooperation and a
revitalized United Nations system. It is necessary for
the Security Council to be more representative in both
the permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect
current geopolitical realities, which is why Japan,
India, Germany and Brazil should be made permanent
members. I also call upon the General Assembly, as the
world’s most representative governance body, to accept
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized
agencies and other world forums.  ","Climate change is a global issue and demands the
full participation of all. We therefore call on the
immediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
process. We must also recognize that climate change
poses many threats — security threats — that are not
addressed under the UNFCCC process. That is why the
Pacific small island developing States introduced in the
General Assembly a resolution on climate change and
its possible security implications (resolution 63/281).
The Security Council, as the primary body of the United Nations entrusted with preserving international
peace and security, must also play its role.
 Lastly, we must ensure that the views and
perspectives of all nations and peoples are incorporated
into the decision-making of the United Nations system
and its specialized agencies. In that context, Nauru
strongly supports Taiwan’s campaign for meaningful
participation in the International Civil Aviation
Organization.
 I would like to conclude by thanking our
development partners for their long-standing
commitment to Nauru, particularly our major
partners — Australia, Taiwan, the Russia Federation,
New Zealand, the European Union and Japan — as
well as our many other active partners, including Cuba,
Italy, India, the Republic of Korea and Israel. We
further recognize the international and regional
organizations that have continued to stand by our side
during a difficult period in our history, and I look
forward to our continuing cooperation. ","In a similar vein, the United Nations should
ensure that all citizens of the world have the
opportunity to participate in its activities. We cannot
continue to ignore the more than 23 million people
who live in Taiwan, who have repeatedly demonstrated
that they are a nation committed to peace and regional
cooperation. We therefore support enabling Taiwan’s
meaningful engagement in connection with the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
and the International Civil Aviation Organization. ","Nauru welcomes the attention that the theme of
this year’s general debate brings to the need to address
disputes by peaceful means, and it commends the
efforts made by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions
and increase cooperation. I call on Member States to
support continuing dialogue between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait and the parties concerned in the East
China Sea dispute to recognize Taiwan’s positive role
in consolidating peace and stability in East Asia. Nauru
urges a rapid and peaceful settlement of the situation
in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in a manner that treats
those affected with dignity and that respects their rights
as a sovereign nation.","Nauru is gratified to note that, with solid
international support and cross-Strait rapprochement,
the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its
meaningful participation in United Nations specialized
agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage
the positive interaction between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore,
I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan
has made to helping my country make progress towards
the Millennium Development Goals. We also express
our gratitude to the Governments of New Zealand, the
Russian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea and
India; they are all invaluable partners in our joint effort
to bring sustainable development to my island.","Similarly, the United Nations should ensure that all
citizens of the world have the opportunity to participate
in its activities. It must work for the 10,000 people in
Nauru and other small countries, and it must not continue
to ignore the 24 million people in Taiwan, who time
and again have demonstrated a commitment to peace
and regional cooperation. Nauru is pleased to note that,
with solid international support and the cross-Strait
rapprochement, the Republic of China has increased its
meaningful participation in United Nations specialized
agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage
the positive interaction between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore,
I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan
has made to help my country make progress towards
its national sustainable development strategy. I take
the opportunity to also express my country’s deep
appreciation to our friends and partners who continue
to support our sustainable development priorities,
including Australia, Russia, New Zealand, the European
Union, Cuba, Israel and Turkey, to mention a few.","All partnerships — whether multilateral, bilateral
or public-private — must be based on mutual respect
that recognizes genuine development partners, such
as the Republic of China on Taiwan, a democracy that
can contribute meaningfully towards development and
prosperity in the world. Needless to say, Taiwanese
technology and know-how can make a lot of difference
towards helping the needy, and, as such, I call for the
inclusion of Taiwan in the development agencies of the
United Nations.","Nauru is also concerned by the mounting tensions
provoked by the recent action of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea. The Pacific region saw far too much
violence and suffering during the previous century. We
must not allow the scourge of war to return. Nuclear
proliferation has no place in a sustainable world.
I would like to address the situation of Nauru’s
close friend, Taiwan. According to the Charter of the
United Nations, our mission here is
“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person, in the
equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small”.
The 23 million people of the Republic of China should
therefore enjoy those same fundamental rights. Taiwan
has contributed to the World Health Assembly and the
International Civil Aviation Organization. The people
are promoting the Sustainable Development Goals
domestically and internationally, and they are helping
to lead the way towards a low-carbon economy. Taiwan
is a key stakeholder in the international community. We
should make efforts to regularize their participation
throughout the United Nations system, so that we can
all benefit from their substantial contributions.","Further to the south, we have in Taiwan a State
that is peaceful, prosperous and happy. Taiwan has
the technical and financial capacity to contribute to
world peace and development, particularly where its
technical prowess and know-how are concerned. It
wishes to contribute and participate freely through
the partnerships and activities of the United Nations
system, including the Sustainable Development
Goals, the World Health Organization, UNESCO, the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and other United Nations-related agencies and
activities. In order to ensure that the Taiwanese people
can make positive contributions to societies around
the world, they must be given the freedom to travel
where they choose. We are, after all, a world that calls
for inclusiveness and for no one to be left behind. In
that same spirit, Nauru renews its call for an end to the
economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed
by the United States on Cuba.","Making the United Nations relevant to all people
must include the people of Taiwan. The treatment of
the people of Taiwan should be equal to that of other
nations. The United Nations should resolve the serious
issue of the exclusion of Taiwan’s 23 million people
from the United Nations system. The Preamble to the
Charter of the United Nations clearly states that the
Organization’s mission is
“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,
in the dignity and worth of the human person, in
the equal rights of men and women and of nations
large and small”.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Governments
of Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the
Russian Federation, Italy, Israel and Cuba, as well as
the European Union for their assistance to Nauru. We
value their friendship very much and look forward to
our continued collaboration.","It is not enough to proclaim the virtues of
multilateralism if we do not strengthen the commitment
to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for
citizens everywhere. Development is not sustainable if it is not fair and inclusive. We therefore call on the
United Nations to embrace willing and capable partners
like Taiwan in its SDG endeavours. Taiwan is ready to
share the experience it has accumulated in reaching its
level of success with its partner countries, including
Nauru. In 2018 alone, Taiwan carried out development
projects in various SDG fields.","Seventy-five years ago, the nations of the world came together to draft a charter
that would stand the test of time. It was created on the principles of universality and
equality, respecting the worth of every individual. It is not enough to proclaim the
virtues of multilateralism if we fail to strengthen our commitment to upholding the
core principles of the Charter.
We therefore call on the United Nations to fulfil our commitments to the human
family and ensure that the 23.5 million people of the Republic of China (Taiwan)
enjoy the same rights as the peoples of other nations. While the world grapples with
the COVID pandemic, the people of Taiwan must not be left behind, nor should
its exemplary response to the global pandemic be ignored. Taiwan is an important
partner in the world’s response to this pandemic. More than ever today we need
inclusivity and solidarity in responding to the global challenges we face."
Nepal,,,,,,,,,,"The massive loss of life and property and the untold
suffering caused by the recent earthquakes to the peoples
of Turkey, Greece and Taiwan have touched the hearts of
the Nepalese people. Indeed, our hearts go out to the
hundreds of thousands of peoples across the globe who
have suffered from both natural and man-made disasters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Zealand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Closer to home, New Zealand welcomes the
recent improvement in cross-Strait relations. CrossStrait stability is vital to the security of the greater
Asia-Pacific region. We encourage China and Taiwan
to maintain the dialogue which has been established. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicaragua,,"Moreover, Germany, Japan, the Republic of China and Switzerland grrAtOd u8 complementary development loan8 for this purpose. Thanks to the firm political will and solidarity of the international community in 8UppOrt of reconciliation and reconstruction in Nicaragua, we will in the coming month8 begin to 8ecure the necessary international financing for our development project8 and progranmes.","I should also like to mention the situation of a nation of 21 million
inhabitants which today has one of the most vigorous economies in the
international system. It is time we acknowledged the important efforts made
by that nation in the economic, political and sc.:al fields. I speak of the
Republic of China in Taiwan. ","The United Nations must respond positively to the
changes in the world today. Nicaragua supports recognition
by the United Nations of the rights of the Republic of China -
Taiwan. We believe it is only right to recognize the
fundamental rights of the 21 million people who live on that
territory. Nicaragua firmly supports this noble initiative.","Finally, we believe that, within the new international
order, it is necessary for the United Nations to recognize
the rights of the Republic of China in Taiwan, within the
framework of universal participation and respect for human
rights.","Nicaragua is in solidarity with the 21 million
inhabitants of the Republic of China in Taiwan, and in this
context we call for resolution of the exceptional situation of the Republic of China through peaceful means, in
accordance with the principles of the peaceful resolution
of disputes between States and within the framework of
the creation of an ad hoc committee of the General
Assembly.","No one doubts that the United Nations has begun a
major process of profound transformation and renewal,
taking place precisely 50 years after its establishment and
reflecting the current international situation. With this
renewal we hope for greater democratization of our world
Organization, particularly in the Security Council. We also
hope for the admission of new Members to the
Organization, such as the Republic of China on Taiwan,
which meets the requirements set forth in the Charter to be
a Member State, but whose right to be a Member is still
denied it. Likewise, we are expecting the United Nations to
contribute to developing countries, particularly through
programmes of technical cooperation and cooperation for
development.","I therefore note with great regret that the 21.5
million people who live in the Republic of China are not
represented in this great Assembly. What is going on,
Mr. President? Everyone knows that the Republic of
China signed the United Nations Charter in 1945.
Domestically, it maintains government structures
guaranteeing its people the exercise of their fundamental
rights and freedoms. In no international forum dealing
with this subject has the Government of the Republic of
China been described as a violator of inalienable rights.
The countries of South-East Asia have seen how the
economy and democratic development of the Republic of
China have been significant factors in the region’s
stability. The international community can attest to the
fact that the Republic of China bases its attitude on the
principles that govern the United Nations Charter,
particularly in its peace-loving nature and its capacity to
make a positive response to the needs of the international
community.
Bearing these facts in mind, I appeal to the
Assembly to amend resolution 2758 (XXVI), which
excludes the Republic of China from the United Nations.
We ought to maintain the principle of universality through
the equal participation of all the States of the world. The
Government of Nicaragua considers that the Republic of
China should enjoy equal opportunity to participate in the
United Nations and its specialized agencies. We cannot
forget the right of those who freely chose to live in and
to build the Republic of China and who want their
country to be recognized with full and effective
participation at the heart of this Organization.","We must bear in mind that the United Nations, as a
supranational body that coordinates and harmonizes the
world’s efforts in many areas, is the most important and
pluralistic forum in which the opinions of all States are
freely expressed and the most important decisions taken
within the framework of world politics. Nevertheless, we
note once again, with great sadness, the absence of the
sister Republic of China, which, as we all know, was a
founding Member of the United Nations in 1945. The international community is aware that the
Republic of China respects the principles that govern the
United Nations Charter, particularly its mission of peace
and broad and generous international cooperation. The
denial of the right of a people to be recognized and
accorded full and effective participation misrepresents and
contradicts the noble spirit of the universal mission of this
Organization and constitutes a painful collective violation
of the human rights of more than 21 million people.
We therefore call once again on the nations of the
world to reconsider resolution 2758 (XXVI), which so
unjustly excludes the Republic of China, with a view to
restoring its right to participate in all the activities of the
United Nations.","I would not want to end without inviting the
Assembly to reflect on the hopes of the 22 million
persons who, at the threshold of the twenty-first century,
continue to lack representation at the United Nations —
the Organization of universal vocation, where the most
important decisions having to do with international policy
are taken. The Republic of China — founded in 1912 and
which has been an independent sovereign nation that maintains official diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and
the other republics of Central America and other
countries — continues, lamentably and unjustly, to be
unrepresented in the Organization. This prevents it from
participating in the work of the Organization and from
making its valuable contribution in the various areas of
international cooperation, despite the fact that it has
complied fully with the provisions of the Charter of the
United Nations, which was signed at San Francisco.
My Government has supported and will continue to
support, with firm and fraternal solidarity, the
unquestionable right of the Republic of China — whose
exercise of full sovereignty over Taiwan for half a century
is an unquestionable reality — to be incorporated as a full
member of the United Nations. We therefore call anew on
the international community not to deny that friendly,
progressive and exemplary people the right to be recognized
and allowed effective participation in this great forum,
thereby affording it the well deserved opportunity of
sharing with us its vocation for peace and its generous
spirit of international cooperation.","We wish also to stress the importance of speedily
beginning a process of international discussions aimed
at attaining greater consensus and effectiveness in
resolving humanitarian emergencies. In another vein,
we believe that we must reaffirm our commitment to
maintain and strengthen the universal mission of the
United Nations to ensure that all the world’s peoples
without exception enjoy fair representation. This brings
me to reaffirm before the Assembly how important it is
to give consideration to the longing of one people to
participate with legitimate representation as a full
Member of the Organization: I refer here to the
Republic of China.","However, this universal vocation cannot be fully
realized as long as a democratic State and signatory of
the San Francisco Charter is unable to participate as a
full-fledged Member within the United Nations system.
As is well known, the Republic of China is a
democratic country, and its freely and transparently
elected Government is the only one that can
legitimately represent the interests and desires of the
people of Taiwan at the United Nations. We should not
continue to deny the 23 million people who live in the
Republic of China the right to be represented in the
United Nations and to share with us the efforts to
promote peace and development for future generations.
Let us recall that the Republic of China has
played a positive role in the promotion of world trade,
the eradication of poverty and the advancement of human rights. These laudable efforts at the national and
international levels must be recognized by the United
Nations; the Republic of China should be given the
right to integrate itself into the international order of
the United Nations, having fulfilled the basic
conditions in accordance with international law.","In this same connection, my country, aware of the
principle of universality and equality that inspired the
United Nations, considers it a priority to permit the 23
million inhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan
to enjoy the universal right to participate in
international affairs through its own delegation to the United Nations, parallel to and with the same rights of
participation as the People’s Republic of China, whose
Government has never exercised hegemony over
Taiwan.","We confirm our commitment to strengthening the
universal vocation of the United Nations so that all
peoples of the world, without exception, can be fairly
represented in it. That is why I reaffirm before the
Assembly the importance of considering the desire of a
people with legitimate representation — the Republic
of China — to participate as a full-fledged member of
the United Nations.","I cannot fail to refer to the question of Taiwan’s
representation in the United Nations. That country,
with 23 million inhabitants, has a democratic
Government and maintains diplomatic, trade and
cooperative relations with many Member States of the
Organization. However, paradoxically, it lacks
membership. That exclusion is inexcusable.","A duty of justice and solidarity moves Nicaragua
to raise its voice in support of the just and legitimate
aspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
become a member of the universal forum of the United
Nations. The more than 20 million nationals of that
country deserve to be regarded as an integral part of
the peoples of the United Nations.","Nicaragua also restates from this podium its
support for the cause of the Republic of China in
Taiwan, which should achieve the legitimate
representation of its 23 million inhabitants. It also calls
for renewed and proactive efforts by the United
Nations to maintain peace in East Asia. ",,,"We support the new and positive focus that
Taiwan has adopted in its relations with the People’s
Republic of China, as well as its participation in United
Nations specialized bodies and agencies. ","We salute the invitation extended by the
international community to Taiwan to participate in the
work of some United Nations specialized agencies
directly related to the well-being of the 23 million
Taiwanese. In this regard, we call on the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
and the International Civil Aviation Organization to
adopt a similar position. ","Looking at other issues, Nicaragua salutes the
international community’s invitation to Taiwan to
participate in the assemblies of United Nations
specialized agencies directly related to the well-being
of the 23 million Taiwanese. We urge other
international forums to adopt similar positions. ","We welcome the recent positive developments with
regard to the relationship between China/Taiwan and
the People’s Republic of China. We have to address the
legitimate aspirations of Taiwan to participate more
broadly in all United Nations specialized agencies and
organs.","Furthermore, Nicaragua continues to support the
just aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan
for greater participation in the various bodies and
specialized agencies of the United Nations.","Nicaragua recognizes the cooperation of China on
Taiwan with developing countries, particularly in the
area of food and social inclusion programmes, and we
reiterate our support for the legitimate aspirations of
China on Taiwan for greater participation in the United
Nations specialized agencies, one that accords with the
requirements and needs of its population of 23 million.",,"We take this opportunity to reiterate our support for
the just aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan
for greater participation in United Nations specialized
agencies, in accordance with the demands and needs of
that brotherly nation of 23 million inhabitants, which
should not be excluded from the Organization.","If we are to achieve the Sustainable Development
Goals, we must repeal unilateral coercive measures
that violate international law and hinder our countries’
development plans. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development was adopted on the basis of the principle
of universality. It is therefore vital to ensure that no
one is left behind, and that includes the 23 million Taiwanese who are entitled to participate in the
implementation of this global agenda. Taiwan is willing
and able to participate in and contribute to the wide
range of substantive United Nations programmes aimed
at improving the well-being of humankind.",,,"In the face of the pandemic, it is essential, for humanitarian reasons, that the
principle of universality be applied so that Taiwan can participate in the corresponding
mechanisms and meetings of the United Nations system."
Niger,,,,,"It is moreover in this spirit that Niger regrets that the
General Assembly was not able to put on its agenda the
item entitled ""Consideration of the exceptional situation of
the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international
context, based on the principle of universality and in
accordance with the established model of parallel
representation of divided countries at the United Nations"".","In this spirit, in this special year in the life of our
common Organization and in accordance with the principle
of universality enshrined in Article 4 of the Charter, Niger
has advocated the establishment of an ad hoc committee to
look into the question of the representation of Taiwan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Palau,,,,,,,,,,,"With regard to open membership, Palau believes
that any State that meets the traditional and standard
definition of independent State should be allowed
membership in the United Nations. To that end, it is the
position of the Republic of Palau that the contributions
of Taiwan to the global community, particularly the
developing countries, more than qualify the Republic
of China on Taiwan to fully participate in the United
Nations as a full-fledged Member. We strongly support
full membership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in
the United Nations and appeal to all States members of
this body for their support.","As I have said, in this new spirit of cooperation,
the process of decision-making and the implementation
of those decisions must be as open and participatory as
possible. This is especially true in the light of the need
to weave together military, financial, law enforcement,
trade, intelligence-gathering and foreign aid issues. In
these troubled times, it simply makes no sense to
isolate a proven ally in the fight against terrorism. Yet
that is what is happening. The Republic of China on
Taiwan, which could and should be a very valuable
asset in these and other cooperative actions, is
significantly restricted in the role it can play because it
has been barred from membership in this body. In fact,
it is the only nation in the world which has no voice in
this Organization.
Not only is the exclusion of Taiwan contrary to
the fundamental, inclusive principles of the United
Nations, but on a more pragmatic level it compromises
security in Asia and the Pacific. Lacking a neutral
forum for the non-violent, diplomatic resolution of any
disputes it might have with the People’s Republic of
China, the Republic of China on Taiwan is at a great
disadvantage in maintaining stable and peaceful
relations in the region. It is simply counterproductive,
from either a practical or a political viewpoint, to
exclude from this body a peaceful, democratically
governed, economically vibrant nation which embraces
human rights and plays a major role in other
international organizations. Resolutions have been put forward which could
correct the erroneous exclusion of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, pave the way to providing a properly
expanded role for the Pacific island countries as such,
and produce greater cooperation and broader support in
all the key works of the United Nations. Now is the
time for the membership to adopt those resolutions in
recognition of the need for full participation of all
peoples in the global events unfolding now and sure to
develop in the foreseeable future.","In light of that fact, Palau must once again note
the folly of excluding any potential partner from the
efforts of the United Nations to meet the challenges we
now face and to prepare against the challenges to
come. Such exclusion is particularly short-sighted in
efforts of the international community that go beyond
politics and address fundamental human concerns, such
as health and education. For that reason, Palau must
again call upon the members of the United Nations to
welcome the Republic of China — Taiwan — into this
Organization. At the very least, the membership at this
body should endorse the participation of the Republic
of China, Taiwan, in the World Health Organization,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the United Nations Development
Programme and similar bodies dedicated to improving
the human condition. Mere politics should not be
allowed to compromise or prevent the development of a truly global effort to alleviate human suffering and
better mankind.","The United Nations is to truly represent all
peoples, with discrimination and exclusion eliminated
from its operational practice. To be effective at
ensuring international peace and security, all nations,
large and small, must be represented in the United
Nations. The Republic of China on Taiwan can no
longer be kept on the sidelines of the most important
international Organization and the leading forum for
international dialogue. Over the past half-century, the
hard-working people of Taiwan have transformed their
country into the world’ s seventeenth largest economy
and a vibrant democracy. In 1996, Taiwan had its first
direct presidential election and, in 2000, accomplished
its first peaceful transfer of executive powers. Since
then Taiwan’s popularly-elected Government has acted
in accordance with United Nations resolutions to
combat international terrorism and to support
humanitarian relief in countries throughout the world,
and yet it is still excluded from the process. Our
experience with SARS has shown us that exclusion can
bring no benefits to anyone. The 23 million Taiwanese
people have an equal right to a voice in the United Nations and should be welcomed by all members of
this body.","First, for the United Nations to be effective at
ensuring international peace and security, all nations,
large and small, should be represented in its
deliberations. The Republic of China on Taiwan should
no longer be kept on the sidelines of the most
important international Organization. The principle of
universality should be applied so that the 23 million
people of Taiwan can bring their talents, their energy
and their principled democratic positions to the
organizations, bodies, specialized agencies and
programmes of the United Nations, thereby aiding the
rest of the world in pursuing our mutual agenda.","A third steady supporter of Palau’s development
has been the Republic of China on Taiwan. We
continue to assert that the world would be benefited by
Taiwan’s membership in this august body. This year
Palau was a sponsor of a resolution calling for a
proactive role for the United Nations in addressing the
rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We regret that the
debate on that important resolution was foreshortened
in the General Committee and that we were prevented
from expressing our views on this topic; however we
are glad that we have an opportunity to do that now.","Taiwan has been another steady supporter of
Palau’s development. We continue to assert that the
world would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the
United Nations and other international institutions.
This year, Palau co-sponsored a draft resolution calling
for a proactive role for the United Nations in
addressing the tensions in East Asia. We were
disappointed that the actions of the General Committee
prevented a debate on that draft resolution. ","We also note our disappointment that Taiwan
continues to be excluded from this Hall. The world
would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the United
Nations and other international institutions. We were
disappointed that the Secretary-General failed to
follow the Charter and the rules of the Security Council
by refusing to transmit and circulate Taiwan’s
membership application to the Security Council and
the General Assembly. Ultimately, legitimate
democracies must be recognized and supported across
the breadth of our planet no matter how large or small
the country. ","We sincerely hope that Taiwan will be able to
participate in the specialized agencies of the United
Nations. The Republic of China’s meaningful
participation in those agencies, such as the World
Health Organization and the International Civil
Aviation Organization, would help promote peace and
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance
important dialogue and help all peoples. ","We note with satisfaction the decision by the
People’s Republic of China to invite Taiwan to attend
the World Health Assembly. The health and safety of
the world’s peoples are at the heart of the ideals of the
United Nations. In order to further promote those
ideals, we recommend that Taiwan be invited to
participate meaningfully in the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change coming up
in Copenhagen and other international organizations
and forums. ","The SARS pandemic shone a bright light on the
gaps in our collective ability to prevent the spread of
diseases internationally. With the participation of
Taiwan, we can now help to fill those gaps. We
congratulate the world community on making itself
healthier by granting Taiwan observer status at the
World Health Assembly. Given the importance of a
universal approach to global problems, Palau advocates
for Taiwan’s inclusion in the activities of the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The world needs its input to ensure civil
aviation safety and security, and to effectively tackle
climate change for the benefit of all. ","I would also like to express Palau’s gratitude for
the strong support and friendship of all of our partners,
new and old. In particular, I would like to thank the
United States of America, Japan and the Taiwan
province of China. In order to further promote the efficacy, goals and
ideals of the United Nations, we recommend that
Taiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the
United Nations system. I believe that the United
Nations cannot fully and properly address the issues of
health, aviation safety and climate change unless
Taiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the
World Health Organization, the International Civil
Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. Once
again, I appeal to the world to allow Taiwan to
participate in these important United Nations entities.  ","We would like to express our gratitude for the
strong support and friendship of our partners for
helping to get those and other important projects off
the ground. Palau thanks especially the United States,
Japan, Australia and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
Palau continues to believe that Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the United Nations system will help to
further promote the system’s efficacy, goals and ideals,
including those of the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).","Palau would also like to acknowledge the significant
support we have received over the years from our friend
Japan. We are hopeful that expansion and reform of the
Security Council will result in permanent membership
of the Council for Japan. In addition, we would like
to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its
friendship and economic support in helping Palau to
achieve its Millennium Development Goals and move
on to the post-2015 development agenda through grants
and technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure,
food security enhancement and human capacity. We
strongly support Taiwan’s expanded participation in
the United Nations system, acknowledge the expansion
of its meaningful participation in United Nations
specialized agencies and mechanisms, and call on the
United Nations system to accept Taiwan’s participation
as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts.","In addition, Palau would like to thank the Republic
of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic
support in assisting Palau to achieve our Millennium
Development Goals and would urge the United Nations
system to involve Taiwan in the process of developing
and implementing the post-2015 development agenda.
I would also call upon the United Nations to support
Taiwan’s broader participation in the United Nations
specialized agencies and regional economic integration
mechanisms, as its participation in the World
Health Assembly, the International Civil Aviation
Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
would demonstrate its ability to contribute to global
and regional initiatives.","Palau would also like to thank the Republic of
China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic
support in assisting Palau to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. Palau also wishes to recognize
Taiwan’s commitment to lowering carbon emissions
by 50 per cent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. We
urge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in
the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. Additionally, we advocate
in favour of Taiwan’s participation in the relevant
international environmental mechanisms, such as the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. Taiwan possesses technical capacities in
many areas that can be shared with the world. It
should therefore also participate in other international
meetings, mechanisms and frameworks such as
the World Health Organization, International Civil
Aviation Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership
Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership, among others. ","The Republic of China — Taiwan — provided
assistance that helped us to achieve our Millennium Development Goals, and we look forward to continued
support from it towards our achievement of the 2030
Agenda. We urge the United Nations system to involve
Taiwan in the processes for implementing the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris
Agreement on Climate Change. We will need all
the resources we can garner, and it will require the
participation of every global citizen to have the push
we need to be successful. The mantra “no one left
behind” must refer not only to benefits, but also to
the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Agenda
was universal in its development and is universal in its
transformational goals. It must also be universal in its
implementation. Finally, Taiwan possesses technical
capacity in many areas which can be shared with the
world. It should therefore participate in international
meetings, mechanisms and frameworks, such as
the World Health Organization, the International
Civil Aviation Organization and various economic
partnerships, inter alia.","Palau also would like to acknowledge the great
friendship that it has with Japan and the very significant
economic support that we have received from that
country over the years. We continue to express our
support for the expansion and reform of the Security
Council and Japan’s permanent membership on the
Security Council. We wish to express our sincere
thanks for the Nippon Foundation’s generous support
to enhance partnership and collaboration in our marine
surveillance and enforcement efforts. We would
also like to recognize the very broad list of partners
across the world who make our efforts to achieve a
sustainable future possible, including the Republic of
China on Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Monaco,
Italy, the Netherlands, the European Union, private
organizations, non-governmental organizations and
civil society, among many others.","The Republic of China, Taiwan has long been an ally
in our efforts to achieve our Sustainable Development
Goals. That special friendship and partnership can
be seen in our infrastructure investments, as well as continued assistance in health and education. We urge
the United Nations to seek a solution that will enable
it to include Taiwan in all its processes, including the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the World
Health Organization. My Government firmly believes
that Taiwan’s inclusion in the United Nations system
will greatly benefit the work of the United Nations and
its 2030 Agenda and beyond. Palau is fortunate to have
gained many newer partners and friends, and I would
like to recognize the European Union, Italy, Indonesia,
New Zealand, Russia, Thailand, Spain, Singapore,
Korea, South Africa, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Viet
Nam and many others.","Our collective commitment to leave no country
behind also demands that we end our exclusion of
Taiwan and its 23 million people, not only here in the
General Assembly but also in the range of international
bodies that are essential to establishing effective
multilateralism, such as the World Health Organization,
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. We know from our partnership with Taiwan
about the strength of its commitment to the SDGs;
its equal and dignified participation in 2030 Agenda
processes will only strengthen our global effort to
realize the Agenda.","Since my first address to the General Assembly as President in 2001, I
have reiterated Palau’s call for Taiwan to be allowed to participate in international
organizations. We regret that this was denied again at this year’s World Health
Assembly. At the very moment when the world needed to come together to respond
to the pandemic, we failed to do so. And I do mean that we failed. Taiwan, a public
health leader that has implemented one of world’s most effective pandemic responses,
was left out of the global response to this pandemic, and that made the world less safe.
In this pandemic, Taiwan has generously shared its experience and expertise
with Palau, including critical support for establishing on-island testing capabilities,
and PPE procurement. The effectiveness of Taiwan’s control over the pandemic has
been recognized by many others, and if included in international health coordination
mechanisms, can also share these lessons with the rest of the world. As such, Taiwan
is one of the only places on earth that is safe enough for quarantine-free travel with
COVID-free nations like Palau. And we are currently working together to create the
world’s first safe bubble economy.
On many other international issues and organizations, such as in the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the International Civil Aviation
Organization, Taiwan can also make meaningful contributions to strengthening
collective action. Taiwanese residents and journalists have been unjustly barred from
accessing UN premises, limiting their ability to engage with the UN’s agenda and
work. We urge others in this Assembly to join us in recognizing that Taiwan Can Help
in responding to so many of our shared challenges. This includes in implementing
the 2030 Agenda, where we often underline the need to leave no-one behind. The 23.5 million people of Taiwan should not be left behind, and it is time for Taiwan’s
exclusion to end."
Panama,,,"In my first address in this forum, two years ago, I referred specifically
to our support for the incorporation of the Republic of Korea into the United
Nations, which we saw as consistent with the atmosphere created by the end of
the cold war. We are delighted that this decision was made a year ago.
Today, in that same spirit, we must give due consideration to the absence of
the Republic of China from this Organization, and we must also consider the
impact that absence has on the role our Organization plays in achieving global
cooperation and coordination. We must acknowledge the impressive economic
development of that country and the progress made in the democratization of
the Republic of China. These factors could help resolve many of the problems
facing this Organization.
For this reason, we invite Member States to initiate serious
consideration of this subject in the spirit of peace and cooperation that has
predominated recently. ","The atmosphere of détente to which I have already
referred should foster the universality of representation in
this multilateral Organization. Consequently I am gratified
to see that many States that have never traditionally had an
active international life, such as Andorra, Liechtenstein,
Monaco and San Marino - to mention only a few States
enclaved in the European continent - have felt the need to
join and support us in the important tasks we are resolved to
accomplish. It is in that spirit of universality that Panama
has supported and continues to support the initiative
designed to study now and in the future, with innovative
ideas and goodwill, the situation of the largest human group
that has no voice in this body: the 21 million inhabitants of
the island of Taiwan.",,"I believe it is appropriate to refer to the request made
by a large number of States, including Panama, to include
the item of the special situation of the Republic of China in
Taiwan on the agenda of the fiftieth session of the General
Assembly. Panama supports this request because it is
interested in the unification of China. But since that
eventuality is as yet unforeseeable as regards the “when”
and “how”, we are convinced that both parties should
coexist and participate jointly in the international
community with equality and mutual respect. Panama, as a
coastal country of the Pacific, and completely sovereign in
the inter-oceanic Canal whose neutrality opens it to
peaceful use by all nations of the world, desires friendship
with all States and wishes to normalize its relations with all
users of this inter-oceanic passage.","Another matter of concern to us relates to the
Chinese people, a people with which Panama has
maintained relations since very early in the last century.
My country has benefitted from a continued migration
which, from the building of the interoceanic railway to that of the Canal, has contributed to our development and
to the fashioning of our national identity. This deep-rooted
and lasting relationship with the Chinese people has
strengthened our nation’s and our Governments’ support for
the principle of the universality of the United Nations.
Panama maintains diplomatic relations with the Republic of
China and feels bound to state that those relations have
been fruitful and beneficial. They have always been
characterized by respect and have been receptive to and
incorporated the interests and needs of both sides. For this
reason, we feel that our relations are exemplary in the best
possible sense.
On the other hand, in a few years’ time Panama will
assume full responsibility for the interoceanic Canal and, in
the context of that responsibility, Panama must
acknowledge that the People’s Republic of China is one of
the main users of the waterway both in terms of the number
of vessels and in terms of the volume of cargo originating
in or destined for the People’s Republic of China. We are
encouraged by the fact that a significant number of Chinese
citizens and companies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
live and work in harmony in Panama, where they have won
the respect and affection of Panamanians because of their
diligent hard work. We are convinced of the validity of the
principle of one China, and we reaffirm our support for the
efforts of both parties to unify the Chinese people. We
reiterate our conviction that they will achieve that purpose
in a framework of mutual respect that gradually helps to
build trust between the two parties and create a favourable
environment for Chinese reunification",,,,,"Other examples of situations that cause
unnecessary friction and that could be resolved through
dialogue are the issues of the Saharan people’s right to
self-determination, the Argentine Republic’s claim to
the Falkland Islands, and the representation of the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations
system while the internal situation of that fraternal
people is being resolved.","Our Government believes that the benefits of the
United Nations system and its various bodies must be
extended to the people of Taiwan, while fostering a
broad debate with the aim of beginning formal,
peaceful negotiations that will lead the people of China
to resolve existing differences.","We also wish to have the General Assembly
become the forum in which to seek a solution to the
problem between the People’s Republic of China and
Taiwan. As Panama has noted on previous occasions,
Taiwan has, in a sense, been left hanging in time and
space, protected and yet unprotected. Recently, in
response to the need to combat the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the World
Health Organization was able to provide direct and
effective assistance to Taiwan without violating or
weakening the fundamental elements of the positions
of the parties to that controversy. We believe that the
United Nations system could act in several ways to
help the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan
resolve their dispute in a peaceful way, while we fulfil
our most cherished objective of responding, without
exception, to the social needs of humanity.",,,,,,,"This global crisis demands newer and better
forms of government for our societies. This global
crisis demands the expansion of our markets and better
management of our intergovernmental relations. In this
context, we appreciate the efforts towards developing
the exchange of goods, workers, tourists and
investments across the China Straits, which offer a new
thrust to achieving the full potential of our trade
relations with that region. ","We also trust in the outcome of dialogue between
the parties in the case of China. Panama, with full
respect for the existing diplomatic truce, calls for
greater participation by Taiwan in international forums
and initiatives, in recognition of the fact that its people
wish to contribute to the pursuit of global peace and
well-being. ","As a firm believer that dialogue is a powerful tool
for facilitating peace and the international political
stability so necessary to ensure economic and social
development for our peoples, Panama wishes to reiterate
its call, as it has done on other occasions, to support the
Chinese people in Taiwan so that they may have greater participation as observers in international forums,
organizations and initiatives and may cooperate and
support the development and maintenance of peace
both in Asia and other parts of the world.",,,,,,,,
Papua New Guinea,,,,,"Firmly committed to maintaining and strengthening
relations with the People’s Republic of China on the basis
of existing agreements, my Government none the less sees
the developing dialogue between the People’s Republic of
China and Taiwan as very promising indeed.",,"Concerned about events earlier in the year, I repeat
last year’s call for the United Nations to do its best to ease
the tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Important regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific have
found ways of following the principle within the region.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution
recommending that the United Nations identify options for
Taiwan to take part in the activities of bodies answerable to
the General Assembly. The United Nations has an
obligation to assist in maintaining a secure environment in
which economic growth and other forms of development can continue for the benefit of the peoples of the region
as well as their partners around the world. It is therefore
time to address the question of Taiwanese participation in
institutions and processes set up to further the universal
objectives of the United Nations Charter.","While we do not understate the importance and
value of our diplomatic relations with the People’s
Republic of China, we have, however, on a number of
occasions urged both Beijing and Taipei to resolve their
fundamental differences with the aim of maintaining an
amicable coexistence. It is in this regard that we recognize Taiwan as a
dynamic economy and trading partner without
compromising our one-China policy. Since Taiwan
participates in such organizations as the Asian
Development Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council, the World Trade Organization and
the South Pacific Forum as a dialogue partner, I cannot see any reason why we should not deal directly with
Taiwan on trade and economic matters.",,"The greatest challenge for the United Nations is to
strengthen the global community's capacity to respond
promptly and effectively to natural disasters. The
devastation caused by the recent earthquakes in Taiwan
and Turkey and by the floods in the United States and in
the Bahamas resulting from hurricane Floyd makes it all
the more imperative for the international community to
take positive action",,,,,"Finally, let me conclude by reaffirming Papua
New Guinea’s support for the one-China policy, which
provides the sound basis for our bilateral relations with
the People’s Republic of China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paraguay,,,,,"We should like to reaffirm that the United Nations
must continue to apply the principle of universality,
making room within its ranks for all peace-loving States
that meet the requirements as set forth in the Charter and
that are prepared to honour its principles and purposes.
We believe that the entry of the Republic of China as an
independent country should be considered, along with the
case of any other State that meets the conditions I have
just mentioned.","Paraguay would like to mention its hope that as a
result of the talks between the two parties, a just and
equitable understanding will be reached to resolve the
situation of the Republic of China, in keeping with the
principle of universality enshrined in the Charter.","Paraguay notes with great satisfaction the results
achieved by the United Nations through its peace-keeping
Missions in Haiti, its observers in Nicaragua and
El Salvador and its verification Mission in Guatemala,
which has achieved major success recently. Paraguay is in
favour of continuing increasingly to promote the
mechanisms of preventive diplomacy and, above all, of
peace-keeping. Similarly, the Republic of Paraguay
welcomes the spirit of reconciliation manifested by the
Government of the Republic of China. We hope that a
dialogue will be established to resolve the situation with the
People’s Republic of China.","With regard to the particular case of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, Paraguay welcomes the attitude adopted
by that country’s Government and expresses its hope that there will be movement towards reconciliation and that it
will be possible to resolve the differences with the People’s
Republic of China.
In keeping with the principle of the universality of the
United Nations, all States that meet the requirements set
forth in the Charter have the right to seek admission or
membership. In this respect, we believe that it would be
advisable to reconsider General Assembly resolution 2758
(XXVI), which completely denies the 21 million inhabitants
of the Republic of China on Taiwan the fundamental right
to participate in international organizations and their
activities.","Based on the fundamental principle of universality,
the Republic of Paraguay feels that the United Nations
system must welcome, without exception, all States that
meet the requirements of the San Francisco Charter.
Given this, and bearing in mind the elements that make
up a State as well as other essential considerations,
Paraguay feels that the proposed participation of the
Republic of China in the United Nations and all its
related bodies must be considered. This is what we would
do with any other State that met the requirements of the
Charter.","My country has firmly decided to keep to the essential
principles of coexistence and civilization; this is a necessary
result of its belonging to the international community.
Following the principle of universality, Paraguay supports
the right of all the peoples of the world to make their
voices heard at the United Nations.
Paraguay believes that the situation in the China Strait
must be resolved within the framework of international law,
non-aggression and peaceful coexistence of nations.
I cannot fail to state here that we share the sorrow of
the people of the Republic of China at the catastrophe
afflicting its territory. We must all commit ourselves to
offering cooperation and help to achieve its full recovery.","I would like to take this opportunity to express
our gratitude — to the international community, to our
friends in the Southern Common Market
(MERCOSUR), the Rio Group, the European Union
and the Organization of American States, and to the
United States of America, Japan, the Republic of China
and other countries around the world — for their
constant support for our process of democratization. I
would like to say to all of them that thanks to their
efforts Paraguay is continuing along the road to
democratic growth.","My country, Paraguay, also hopes that other areas
of tension in the world may be settled. In this regard,
mindful of the principle of universality enshrined in
our Charter, we advocate a solution to the question of
the Republic of China and Taiwan within the
framework of the norms of international law.","The Government of Paraguay, in keeping with the
position it has been maintaining and expressing
concerning the question of the Republic of China on
Taiwan, would once again reaffirm its strong wish that
this issue be considered within the framework of
universality embodied in our Charter and on the basis
of norms of international law, in order to achieve a
satisfactory solution through dialogue among the
parties concerned.","Paraguay would like to reiterate here its full
support for the efforts and aspirations of the Republic
of China on Taiwan to become a fully-fledged member
of the international community through the United
Nations. In this regard, we appeal to the principles of
universality contained in the Charter so that this longoverdue and heartfelt desire of the sister Republic of
China on Taiwan may be fulfilled.","Similarly ó and in keeping with Paraguayís
position on Taiwan in the United Nations ó we once
more reaffirm our conviction that the brotherly
Republic of China, Taiwan, should become a fullfledged Member of the Organization, in accordance
with the principle of universality and with norms of
international law.","Similarly, we reiterate, as we have done year after
year, our formal support for Taiwanís inclusion in the
United Nations, so that the brotherly and supportive
Republic of China can have a place and become an
integral part of our Organization as a full-fledged
Member, in accordance with the principle of
universality and the norms of international law.","With regard to the question of the representation
in the United Nations of the 23 million inhabitants of
Taiwan, Paraguay, consistent with the position it has
long held, confirms its support in favour of their
admission to the United Nations. Their inclusion is
consistent with the principle of universality embodied
in our Charter, as well as with the norms of
international law. ","The Government of Paraguay would also like to
take this opportunity to express once again for its
support for the request for admission into the United
Nations of the Republic of China, Taiwan, a nation that
has continued to struggle for its freedom and wishes to
be a member of the United Nations in accordance with
Rules 59 and 60 of the Provisional Rules of the
Security Council and Article 4 of the United Nations
Charter. ",,,,,,"My Government has observed with satisfaction
that the Republic of China on Taiwan has achieved a
greater presence in the specialized agencies and bodies
of the United Nations, thanks to solid international
support and a rapprochement between both parties
on the Taiwan Strait. My Government will continue
to encourage the positive interaction between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international sphere.","I also wish to note that Paraguay recognizes
and welcomes the participation and contributions
of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to United Nations
specialized agencies, thanks to a rapprochement
between the two parties of the Taiwan Strait. In a
world beset by conflicts, my Government welcomes
the efforts made by the Republic of China (Taiwan)
to reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait, which
have contributed significantly to ensuring peace and
stability.","Paraguay welcomes the efforts undertaken by the
Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
reduce tension across the Taiwan Strait, efforts which
have contributed greatly to ensuring peace and stability
in East Asia. Our Government advocates continuing the
pragmatic dialogue and mutually beneficial interaction
between both sides of the Strait, parties that are also
recognized by the international community.","Our Government, founded on traditional relations
of friendship and cooperation with the Republic of
China on Taiwan, appeals for that country to have an
enhanced presence in the agencies and programmes of
the United Nations system. ","Through international cooperation, the Republic of
China on Taiwan has long been engaged in cooperation
programmes related to the Millennium Development
Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. It
supports many countries, including Paraguay. Taiwan
has relevant knowledge and experience and has
contributed effectively to the international community.
The Government of Paraguay once again urges all
Member States to identify appropriate ways to facilitate
Taiwan’s participation in the mechanisms for meetings
and activities of the United Nations system, so that its
23 million inhabitants can exercise their responsibilities
normally as global citizens and establish sustainable
alliances with every country.","Paraguay respects international law. All of my
Government’s decisions are based on its principles,
and we faithfully implement all General Assembly and
Security Council resolutions. My country supports
Taiwan’s legitimate request to be included in the
United Nations system and believes that Taiwan can
make a major contribution to our work. This is all
based on the principle of universality that characterizes
our Organization.",,"Based on the principle of universality for which the Organization is known, we
support Taiwan’s request to be included in the United Nations system."
Rwanda,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I should like to recall that, with the collapse of
the Berlin Wall and the end of the ideological war often
referred to as the cold war, the world entered a new era,
with a new economic order. Despite the existence of
hotbeds of violence in a number of areas on all
continents, we welcome and encourage initiatives
designed to resolve the tensions created during the cold
war. In that connection, the Rwandan Government
encourages talks between North and South Korea. We
hope that the two parties will move forward towards
the peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. The
Rwandan Government also supports the principle of
one China. The question of Taiwan is an internal matter
for China and can be effectively resolved out of the
context of the ideological war that gave rise to it, in
accordance with the principle, already accepted by the
Chinese themselves, of one country and two systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saint Kitts and Nevis,,,,"It is clear that membership in the United Nations is
neither a deterrent to reunification, as we saw in the case of
Germany, nor to fragmentation, as we saw in the case of the
Soviet Union. Whatever the aspirations of a country’s
people, as determined by that people, these can be
accommodated within the framework and forum of the
United Nations, which is more effective as an organ
operating by a process of inclusion than one operating by a
process of exclusion.
In that context, my Government calls on the United
Nations to begin the process that would eventually lead to
the admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into this
Organization. The Republic of China on Taiwan has proved
itself to be a country that espouses the principles inherent in
the United Nations Charter, a country dedicated to peace,
social tranquillity and economic development, not only for
its people, but also for the peoples of other nations.","Another way in which the United Nations can be made
more globally inclusive is by bringing more Members into
the fold. Last year, my Government called upon the United
Nations to begin the process that would lead to the ultimate
re-admission of the Republic of China in Taiwan into the
United Nations.
My Government stands firmly behind that appeal and
we repeat this appeal here today. The Republic of China
in Taiwan continues to adhere to the Charter of the United
Nations and to govern itself by the principles of
international and humanitarian law. It has proven
repeatedly that it is a country committed to peace,
democracy and development, not only for its 21 million
people, who are entitled to proper representation
internationally, but for all peoples, that their quality of life
may be improved. The Republic of China in Taiwan is a
major international player in commerce, trade and
development assistance, and would make a significant
contribution to the work of the United Nations.","I should like to focus the Assembly’s attention on
the question of membership. As we all are well aware,
one of the fundamental principles of this Organization is
that of universality of membership. My Government
perceives the United Nations as a people’s organization;
therefore, we believe that Member States will appreciate
the need to consider the timely readmittance of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to this body. The
Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis maintains that that
country’s 21 million inhabitants have the right to be
appropriately represented in this Organization. Taiwan
continues to comply with international law and has taken
due steps to ensure the democratization of its politics and
respect for and protection of human rights.","We have circulated a document which reflects our
policy regarding Taiwan. Our policy is to respect the
territorial integrity of all countries and to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of all Member States.
Because of our traditional relationship with the 21.3 million
people on Taiwan, we have come to respect their economic
stability and progress. Their growing democracy and their
contribution to the developing world have not gone
unnoticed.
We believe they have an important and continuing role
to play in international development strategies. We are
confident that whatever difficulties exist between the
Chinese people separated by the Taiwan Strait can be
resolved by the Chinese people themselves and in a spirit
of fraternity and good will. We urge the international
community to be ready, if necessary, to provide the
mechanisms to facilitate dialogue and cooperation.
Resolution of the stalemate would significantly contribute
to the cause of development worldwide and to peace and
security in the region.","Saint Kitts and Nevis also urges the Chinese people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to commit their collective
energies to the pursuit of common approaches to resolving
the current impasse that divides them. The Government of
Saint Kitts and Nevis maintains that progress on this issue
requires sustained dialogue, political will and the goodwill of all. We also believe that the remarkable strides the
Chinese people on Taiwan have made in the last two
decades should not be squandered. The international
community can benefit, and stands to benefit significantly,
from the economic, technological and social advances of
Taiwan.","In the spirit of advancing the human condition, my
Government urges restraint, patience and dialogue on the
critical issues that separate the Chinese people in both
geographic and political terms. It is our sincerest hope that
the common aspirations and expectations of the Chinese
people will be fulfilled in the near future in an environment
of peace and mutual respect. We believe that the family
bonds and historical tradition that have made the Chinese
people a great nation ought to be preserved. We believe
that the time has come for the voice of the millions of
Chinese people in the Republic of China on Taiwan to be
heard and factored into the international agenda. We believe
that adequate, urgent and practical mechanisms must be
developed to allow them to participate in the work of all
nations.","At this point, Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to
express profound condolences to the Government of the
Republic of China on Taiwan on the loss of lives which
resulted from the recent devastating earthquake. We hope
that the process of recovery will be speedy. I call on the
international community, therefore, to come to the
assistance of Taiwan, which in times past has assisted
willingly in bringing relief to countries facing similar
disasters.
Let me know say a word about the unsettled issue of
the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In
doing so, let me first make it clear that it never has been
and is not now the intention of my country to interfere in
the internal affairs or to give offence to any State
Member of the United Nations. Saint Kitts and Nevis is
persuaded that the Chinese people have the capacity and
the accumulated wisdom to find a solution to whatever
their differences appear to be, but our relationship with the authorities of the Republic of China, with whom we
have conducted diplomatic relations since our independence
in 1983, convinces me that the 22 million Chinese on
Taiwan have a valuable contribution which they can make
to international dialogue. The record of their development
as a freedom-loving, peaceful, pluralistic democracy; the
miraculous rebuilding of their economy; and their
contribution to developing countries are all attributes which,
in our view, require that they be recognized as being
capable of making a contribution in international forums,
including those of the United Nations.","In addition, St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates its call
for discussion of the Chinese people on Taiwan. Again,
we emphasize that our policy seeks to promote respect
for the sovereignty of States. However, as we reflect on
the mission of this institution, we deem it appropriate
to consider the invaluable contribution of the 23
million Chinese people on Taiwan who can add great
substance to international discourse.","It is within this context that I urge this body to
redouble its efforts in finding a solution to the
unfortunate stalemate that beleaguers relations between
the Chinese people across the Taiwan Straits. My
Government remains convinced that both sides of the
Taiwan Straits should become fully engaged in this
peaceful and non-coercive process without the
distraction of preconditions. It would lead to the
successful resolution of what appears to be a very
contentious issue. At the same time, we encourage the
United Nations to be vigilant and ready to assist where
possible or when required. Prior to the peaceful
settlement of their dispute, it is imperative that we
establish a mechanism by which the international
community can benefit more appropriately from the
proven expertise, technical know-how and skills of the
23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.","Representation is crucial to the peoples of the
world, and, as my delegation has done in the past, I
wish to re-emphasize the status of the people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan. Membership in this
Organization is in itself a validation and celebration of
a people’s fundamental human rights. We therefore
lament the continued stalemate that results in the
exclusion of the people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan from the United Nations family.
The contribution of the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the global market, to
the international community in the areas of technology,
technical assistance and development assistance is
unmistakably significant. Its participation in
international activities can rival, and in many instances
surpasses, that of many developed countries who are
full Members of the United Nations. It is unfortunate
and most regrettable, therefore, that the United Nations
has been unable to create a meaningful and practical
formula that would allow the Chinese people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits to resolve this impasse,
which stymies the genuine hopes and desires of
millions of people who adhere to the principles of the
United Nations Charter and whose nation is a model
international citizen.","Despite its exclusion from this international
fraternity of nations, the Republic of China on Taiwan
remains a valuable partner for peace and development
with fullest respect for international law. We trust that
its contributions and its citizens’ right to adequate representation can be guaranteed in the best interest of
brotherhood so that all people can live in peace and
enjoy the fruits of prosperity through partnership.
Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore urges the
United Nations to avail itself of every possibility to
facilitate a sustainable resolution of the impasse that
hampers Taiwan’s efforts to engage in international
dialogue and contribute to the common interests of
mankind.
Let me end by reaffirming my Government’s
commitment to multilateralism and to strategic
partnership","Good governance should propel us to recognize
the fact that nearly 23 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan are essentially in a diplomatic black
hole, alienated from our international discourse. Good
governance requires all peace-loving nations to urge
both sides of the Taiwan Straits not only to commit to,
but also to engage in constructive dialogue and
preventive diplomacy. Good governance behooves us
to support the hard work of the leaders and people of
the Republic of China on Taiwan to comply with and
work within the framework of international law. Good
governance says to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that a
people committed to the rule of law and democracy and
willing to invest in human development at home and
abroad should never be excluded from the fraternity of
nations.","The people of Taiwan continue to be excluded
from the brotherhood of nations, which was created to
represent the hopes and aspirations of all peoples. My
Government reiterates its call for the people of the
Republic of China, Taiwan, to be consulted, effectively
represented and invited to participate in the critical
debates on world peace, human security, development
and human rights. I believe that we would have failed
to promote human rights effectively if, through
political exclusion, generations of people are relegated
to the margins of such important issues and the forums
that facilitate their discussion.","That is why Saint Kitts and Nevis has stood at
this rostrum time and time again, and called for the
human rights of the people of the Republic of China —
Taiwan — to be acknowledged in this body. The
Republic of China is a democratic country that has
continued to embody the principles of the United
Nations. That country has continued to ensure that
human rights and human development are nurtured and
preserved together, and has many contributions to
make in the pursuit of a global partnership for
development. It has been a great and magnificent
friend to several States members of the United Nations
family, and not just those with which it has diplomatic
ties. We, as the pre-eminent international body, owe the
Republic of China and its 23 million people our
support and acceptance, and we owe ourselves the
benefit of having the Republic of China fully
participating in the United Nations system. ","In the context of the principle of universality, my
country renews its call for Taiwan to become a
Member of the United Nations. It is of grave concern
that the 23 million people of Taiwan have been denied
the right to participate in the United Nations and its
related bodies. During the sixty-first session, that
exclusion and isolation were pursued even more
aggressively.
 We, the friends of Taiwan, implore the United
Nations family to recognize that the people of Taiwan
are a disenfranchised people. Many of us were once
also disenfranchised and unrepresented; but, through
international recognition of our inalienable right to
participate, we are here today. My delegation wishes to
see the same right enjoyed by the people of Taiwan.
 Taiwan has shown that it can be a true partner in
development. In our view, the international community
has been deprived of the gift of that partnership at a
time when Taiwan’s assistance could have been so
useful to many States in meeting the Millennium
Development Goals. ","On the issue of bilateral relations, I am pleased to
say that we have built many deeply valued
relationships over the years, and we continue to further
strengthen those relations. In the light of that, we urge that a way be found to facilitate the participation of the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized
agencies of the United Nations. As world challenges
have expanded, the Republic of China on Taiwan has
stepped forward to provide technical assistance in the
areas of social and agricultural development, as well as
disaster relief in many countries, thus bringing
enormous benefits to both public and private sectors. ","In multilateralism, constructive partnership is an
effective strategy. In such an approach, we are forced
to appreciate the value of belonging: the need for all
peoples of the world to be embraced within the
fraternity of nations and to be allowed to contribute to
the common good. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a
constructive partner to a range of countries around the
world for so long, has a great deal to contribute to
specialized agencies and programmes of the United
Nations, such as the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the International
Civil Aviation Organization, given that climate change
and aviation safety affect its own development, as well
as the well-being of all mankind. ","Cognizant of the spirit of cooperation, the
Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis thanks the
Government and people of Taiwan for their continued
outstanding support, international cooperation and
development assistance over several decades. I
welcome the recent passage in that country’s
Parliament of their international cooperation and
development law, which incorporates the essence and
principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
and the United Nations MDGs. We owe them a debt of
gratitude for their efforts and for sharing their
development experience through public projects and
social, agricultural and private sector development. ","Since 2009, Taiwan has been invited by the World
Health Organization to attend the annual World Health
Assembly (WHA) as an observer. This practice and the
related arrangements have established what has been
termed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent
for Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations
system. It is the view of my country that in today’s
highly integrated and interconnected world almost all
issues demand full participation by, and cooperation
among, international partners. As one of the world’s
leading economic and technological powerhouses,
Taiwan can contribute substantially to the international
community.
 We therefore urge the United Nations to find a
suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in its specialized agencies and
mechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. I have presented some of the challenges that we
encounter as a country and region, challenges to which
the Assembly has itself given prominence. I have also
given consideration to some of our aspirations for the
sixty-sixth session and beyond. They are issues that
demand collective inputs and interventions. ","Throughout the 29 years of our existence as a
sovereign nation, the Republic of China on Taiwan
has been a highly valued partner and ally. Throughout
my nation, evidence of our collaborative efforts
abound in areas as diverse as agriculture, agritourism,
green energy, information technology, community
development and education, to name just a few.
In my own nation or even my region, however,
Taiwan’s unfailing and valued contributions to the
work of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation
Organization, the World Health Assembly and other
forums have long demonstrated its outstanding
credentials as a valued and impactful member of the
global community. It is only fitting and just that all
remaining strictures pertaining to Taiwan’s standing
among the international community of nations be
removed. Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to this body to
ensure that that will indeed be done.","Thirty years ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis established
diplomatic relations with several countries, including
the Republic of China on Taiwan. In the intervening
years, this relationship has been mutually beneficial.
As the debate on sustainable development unfolds,
Saint Kitts and Nevis is eminently qualified to speak
on the myriad contributions that the Republic of China
is capable of making to the international community.
While the international community is preoccupied with
ensuring peace and security globally, we can applaud
the Government of the Republic of China for promoting
peace across the Taiwan Strait and proposing the East
China Sea Peace Initiative, thereby demonstrating a
commitment to peace and stability.
Taiwan is one of the top 18 economies globally. In
addition, Taiwan has worked assiduously to advance
the economic interests of countries such as ours. In
this regard, we have collaborated on a large number
of key projects, such as the multisectoral agritourism
demonstration farm, our high-priority solar energy farm
and an information and communications technology
centre, which are all designed to advance the social and
economic interests of my small nation.
I wish to place on record my delegation’s
appreciation to the World Health Organization for
having invited Taiwan, for five consecutive years,
to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an
observer. We are of the view that Taiwan has adopted a
very pragmatic approach to its meaningful participation
in United Nations specialized agencies and functional
organizations that are critical to the current global
efforts to address many issues of mutual concern. My
delegation is convinced that the arrangements made
for Taiwan’s presence in the World Health Assembly,
which have been referred to as the WHA model, serve as a useful point of reference for Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in other international agencies, such as
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
and the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change. While on that note, permit me to
commend Mr. Roberto Kobeh González, President of
the ICAO Council, on the decision to invite Taiwan to
attend this month’s thirty-eighth ICAO Assembly as a
special guest.","Thirty-one years ago, our new nation forged a
strategic and mutually beneficial relationship with
the Republic of China on Taiwan. That relationship
has grown by leaps and bounds, and it touches all
three dimensions of sustainable development. As
the dialogue continues on the implementation of the
post-2015 development agenda, Saint Kitts and Nevis
regards itself suitably qualified to speak on the valuable
contribution which the Republic of China on Taiwan
can make to the international community.
At the recent SIDS Conference in Samoa, our
Prime Minister had the privilege to speak of the value
of the partnership established with the Government
and private sector of Taiwan in implementing a number
of projects in renewable energy, specifically the
establishment of a solar panel manufacturing plant and
the outfitting of Government buildings and street lights
with solar panels. The latter project will assist us in
Saint Kitts and Nevis to achieve the goal of ensuring
access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
services for all.
For many years, our Government has called for
the international community to allow the Republic
of China on Taiwan to participate in the work of the
organs of the United Nations system. That call is by
no means arbitrary in nature. It has resulted from
our partnership in numerous development initiatives
across the sustainable development spectrum. Saint
Kitts and Nevis is therefore pleased to note that Taiwan
was recently invited to attend the Assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization for the first
time since 1971. We are equally pleased to note the
participation of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly
and to offer our commendation to the Government and people of Taiwan for sharing their expertise in the fields
of medicine and civil aviation safety.At this juncture, we are convinced that the time
is right for that spirit of understanding and inclusion
to extend to the area of the ongoing negotiations
in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and the United Nations Environment
Assembly. My Government is equally convinced that
the experiences gained by Taiwan in its strategy for
building environmental and economic resilience can be
shared with the international community through the
UNFCCC.
While the international community is focused
on maintaining peace and security, we are pleased to
underscore the active role played by the Government
of the Republic of China on Taiwan in promoting peace
and security across the Taiwan Strait and for proposing
the East China Sea Peace Initiative, thus demonstrating
its commitment to international peace and security.","My Government is pleased to draw the international
community’s attention to the invaluable contribution
by the Government of the Republic of China on
Taiwan in the areas of international cooperation,
health, technology and peace and security. We live in
an age when global partnership is a prerequisite for
solving complex problems at the international level.
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is proud to
announce that a relationship established more than
three decades ago has yielded benefits in every area of
sustainable development. Such a level of engagement
between a developing country and its partner in
development is indeed a model fit for consideration
by small States such as ours in their quest to achieve
sustainable development.","Additionally, in the past three decades, the tangible
support of the Government and the people of Taiwan has
been remarkable. Taiwan has stood shoulder to shoulder
with the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and
Nevis and remains steadfast in its commitment to support
our determination to meet our people-empowerment
agenda. Their help and solidarity touch almost every
facet of life in our twin-island federation. Such
advantages and benefits should not be limited to a few countries. I know that Taiwan is eager to share its
progress and development successes with the rest of
the world. I therefore recommend new opportunities
for Taiwan and its people to be warmly welcomed and
integrated into the international fraternity of nations as
a global player whose commitment to the principles of
democracy, peace and people empowerment can touch
many more lives.","In that regard, we call on the international community
yet again to look at our dear friend, Taiwan — a modern
country of 23 million people that has had tremendous
successes in technology, agriculture, health, and
renewable energy; a country that is a model of peace
and security. Saint Kitts and Nevis has experienced
first-hand the benefits of partnership with Taiwan.
There is much that it can offer, and we lose collectively
when we seek to isolate and prevent our fellow nations
from having a seat at the international table. Saint Kitts
and Nevis continues its unwavering support for the
Government and the people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to be included in the United Nations and other
international agencies. There is much that we can learn
from Taiwan, and we can no longer afford to ignore the
voices of its 23 million people.","I cannot address this great body without
recognizing our dear friend, Taiwan. My Government
views the United Nations as an organization for all
people, including the people of Taiwan. We strongly
believe that Taiwan has an important and continuing
role to play in international development strategies, as
it has achieved great success in technology, agriculture,
health and renewable energy. We advocate that Taiwan
be given space to add to the dialogue, progress and
well-being of the global community. We also continue
to voice our support for our Caribbean sister, Cuba, and
call for the normalization of relations between Cuba
and the United States of America in order to alleviate
the real suffering caused to the Cuban people by the
policy of exclusion. My country is conscious of the
current difficulties in Venezuela. Venezuela has been a
very good friend to the Caribbean, and Saint Kitts and
Nevis continues to call for peaceful dialogue aimed at
resolving the issues in that country, with due regard to
the rule of law and the democratic ideals that we hold
dear.","Saint Kitts and Nevis has nurtured relations with
the Republic of China on Taiwan, and that has been
of immense benefit to us, given Taiwan’s experience
and expertise in such areas as technology, renewables
and health care. I call on the United Nations to utilize
Taiwan’s experience, resources and expertise and to enable other developing nations to benefit from it as
well. Our experience over the past 36 years is that the
Republic of China on Taiwan offers true friendship and
solidarity to its allies and is prepared to assist the rest
of the global community.","St Kitts and Nevis once again renews its call for Taiwan’s inclusion in
this international fraternity of Nations. The Republic of China (Taiwan) remains
a valuable partner for peace, prosperity and development with the fullest respect
for international law. Taiwan has stayed true to its longstanding traditions and has
remained a true partner in in fight against COVID-19. We have seen first-hand
Taiwan’s exemplary management of the pandemic within its own borders and we
have been impressed by its willingness to help vulnerable states around the world.
Taiwan has assisted many states in combatting this unprecedented health pandemic
by sending more than 51 Million surgical masks as well as other medical equipment
to more than 80 countries. In our view, the international community has been
deprived of the gift of true partnership offered by the 23.5 million people of Taiwan.
My hope is that Taiwan can be included in the UN system, particularly the WHO —
its meetings, mechanisms and activities thereby improving the global response and
resources available to address transboundary crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The exclusion of Taiwan — its experience, expertise and resources, leaves a partial
vacuum in the global response to COVID-19. The World Health Organisation can
only benefit from the inclusion of such a worthy member. Equally, the existence of
the antiquated embargo against Cuba flies against the spirit of global partnerships
which we desire in the future. At this time more than ever vulnerable Nations
must be free to access Cuba’s expertise in health, and a myriad of other areas of
global concern."
Saint Lucia,,,,"It was also in furtherance of the spirit of universality
and its all-embracing purpose that Saint Lucia joined 11
other Member States of the United Nations in proposing the
inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda aimed at
obtaining General Assembly agreement for the establishment
of an ad hoc committee to study the situation of the
Republic of China in Taiwan. That study would have
focused on the search for an equitable, rational and practical
solution that would enable the Republic of China in Taiwan
to become a full Member of the United Nations.
Unfortunately, this new but overdue initiative suffered a
temporary setback in the General Committee. However, I find it difficult to envisage that a country of
21 million people, whose industriousness has contributed to
making their country the fourteenth-largest trading nation in
the world, can continue to be impeded from becoming a
Member of this Organization, where they will be afforded
the opportunity to discharge their international obligations
more fully. In keeping with its belief in the concept of
universality, Saint Lucia gives support to the Government
and people of the Republic of China in Taiwan in their
aspiration to become full Members of this world
Organization.","In keeping with the spirit of universality that prevails
today, Saint Lucia had hoped that the question of full
membership of the United Nations for the Republic of
China on Taiwan would be favourably considered as a
supplementary item on the agenda. Saint Lucia continues
to lend its support to the Republic of China on Taiwan in
its efforts to achieve full membership of the United
Nations, and urges the inclusion of this item on the agenda
of the fiftieth session. It is indeed anomalous that a
country already making a valuable contribution on the
international stage should continue to find itself debarred
from participation in the family of nations.","In preceding sessions of the Assembly, my country has
drawn attention to the Republic of China on Taiwan’s
request to take its rightful place within this family of
nations. Our support for this request in no way implies an
attack on the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of
China, nor is it meant to vitiate the intention of resolution
2758 (XXVI). My country is acutely aware of the need to protect the
fundamental principles of our institutions, but it is not
beyond the creativity of the Assembly to play a catalyst
role in resolving the impasse between the Republic of
China and the People’s Republic of China. Recent military
manoeuvres in the Taiwan Straits provide an eerie warning
of the possibility of deteriorating relations between the two
countries. The Assembly should not wash its hands of the
issues like Pilate, but should exhaust the possibilities of
preventive diplomacy rather than live to bemoan the tragedy
of inaction.
Saint Lucia continues to be of the view that Taiwan’s
presence in the United Nations will help to further the goals
and ideals of our Organization. Saint Lucia’s support for
Taiwan’s bid for a seat in this body is in the knowledge
that this does not preclude the eventuality of reunification.","While Saint Lucia continues to promote the unification
of China, we still hold the view that Taiwan should be
given the opportunity to participate in and contribute to the
work of the United Nations. Taiwan is a vibrant and
growing democracy, capable of meeting its obligations to
this institution. As a highly developed economy, Taiwan is
also capable of contributing to the growth of other smaller,
less developed economies of the world. At a time when the
Powers that have traditionally assisted the economic
development of our countries have significantly reduced the
level and quality of their support, new sources of assistance
should not be ignored. We are confident that this body can
find a creative mechanism through which Taiwan can be
involved in the programmes of the Organization. That
involvement in the work of the United Nations should in no
way preclude unification.","For us, foreign policy is about building bridges to
other people, other cultures and other markets. It is about
contributing to the emergence of a new climate of tolerance
and international understanding; it is about matching
domestic need with international possibility. Consistent with
these basic principles, Saint Lucia has proceeded in a
direction in which the majority of the States of the world
have already gone by establishing diplomatic links with the
People’s Republic of China.","Our common humanity must demonstrate itself in our
prompt response to natural disasters in each other's
countries. The people of Taiwan have been the most recent
victims of devastating earthquakes, which claimed the lives
of thousands of innocent people. We commiserate with
them. It is at such critical moments that the spirit of
brotherhood must emerge. There was a surge of hope at the
news that the People's Republic of China had pledged
assistance to the Taiwanese across the Taiwan Strait. Let us
hope that the Creator is working in a mysterious way to
bring about the peaceful and mutually agreeable
reunification of the Chinese people on this occasion of the
fiftieth anniversary of China.",,"In the case of Taiwan and China, it is vital that
we pursue the line of working towards a one-China
policy instead of fuelling the hostilities that
characterize the existing relationship between these
two countries. An early resolution of the impasse
between Taiwan and China will strengthen the
solidarity of the developing world.",,,,,,,"Many, if not all of our countries celebrate our
sovereignty with pomp, ceremony and pride, and in
accordance with that sovereignty, we take our seat in
this body. All of the rules and requirements for
membership are spelled out in the Charter of our noble
institution. Within this body our relationship with our
partners is based on a commitment to the principles of
mutual respect and understanding. For this reason, we
recognize that the Republic of China — Taiwan — a
democratic country of over 23 million people, has
continued to abide by the principles enshrined in the
Charter of the United Nations, although it is not a
Member of the United Nations. Taiwan has made
significant contributions to global development by
providing economic and technical assistance to other
developing countries in their pursuit of development
and their attainment of the MDGs.
 We believe that sovereignty is derived from the
will of peoples and from the realization or actualization
of the right to self-determination. We are therefore
saddened that the will of the people of Taiwan,
expressed by their duly elected representatives,
continues to be ignored by this body. Saint Lucia
therefore looks forward to the day when Taiwan will
assume its place alongside other countries of the world
in the halls of this Organization. ","Saint Lucia’s relationship with its partners is
based on a commitment to mutual respect and
understanding for each other. In that vein, Saint Lucia  pays tribute to the Government and the people of the
Republic of China, Taiwan, a democratic country that
has continued to abide by the very principles that the
United Nations holds dear, seeking to nurture and
preserve human rights and development. We
acknowledge the contribution that the Republic of
China, Taiwan, has made to international development
by its provision of substantial development assistance
to developing countries in the spirit of South-South
cooperation. The Government of Taiwan has provided
significant cooperation assistance to Saint Lucia and
other States in the areas of education, health,
agriculture and tourism. ","That is why the Government of Saint Lucia joins
with other delegations in extending our deep
condolences to the Government and people of Taiwan
following the devastation and loss of life caused by the
disastrous Typhoon Morakot in August. Taiwan has
assisted Saint Lucia in the areas of education,
agriculture, health and other fields critical to our
development efforts. Their assistance in agriculture,
especially, has enabled us to improve our output and
position ourselves for breaking into the food export
market. Taiwan has extended a helping hand to all
those who have requested it. It seeks only to be part of
the family of nations and to share its knowledge and
expertise with the rest of the world. That is not too
much to ask. We are pleased to note that some positive
steps have been taken in this respect, and we hope they
will continue, with other agencies opening their doors
to participation and thus to enable 23 million people to
make their contribution to their fellow human beings
and to realize their aspirations, as we in Saint Lucia did
30 years ago. ","In attempting to fulfil our commitments on the
MDGs, we have engaged many partners, including the
United States, the European Union, Canada, our Latin
American neighbours, India, Japan and South Korea, to
name but a few. I wish, though, to make a special
appeal to this body to support the aspirations of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to make its contribution
to the world collaboration through membership and
effective participation in the air transport and health
bodies and climate change discussions, including the
International Civil Aviation Organization, the World
Health Organization, the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and other organizations
of a universal nature.
 The contribution of Taiwan to countries that have
sought its assistance in these areas matches that of any
other, and it has helped without asking for much in
return. No country should be prevented from making
its contribution to humankind, for they do share the
world with us and their contribution to health and
environmental issues know no boundaries. ","In the spirit of the greater good, we are pleased
that, since 2009, Taiwan has been able to participate in
the World Health Association (WHA), in recognition of
the fact that global health issues require universal
participation and cooperation to overcome those major
problems that affect the peoples of every corner of the
globe.
 Sustainable development, like health, is one of
those issues that require global participation and
cooperation. Taiwan is a leading economic and
technological powerhouse and can contribute
substantially not only to health but to a range of global
issues that face the world today. We urge the United
Nations to find suitable means to permit Taiwan to
participate in its specialized agencies and mechanisms,
including the International Civil Aviation Organization
and the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change all of which have worldwide
implications, along the lines of the WHA model.
Surely, 25 million people living on planet Earth can
contribute to this body of peoples. ","Saint Lucia believes that all efforts to promote
peace and prosperity for everyone, while of course
protecting the health of our planet, should be embraced.
The Government of Saint Lucia is well aware of the
determination of the Chinese people to unify their
country, as signalled to the world when China took its
rightful place in the United Nations. In that context,
Saint Lucia welcomes the emerging dialogue and
cooperation between the People’s Republic of China
and the Republic of China on Taiwan. Such cross-strait
dialogue and cooperation will surely facilitate global
harmony. We look forward to a continued evolution of
the ongoing peaceful rapprochement among the Chinese
people as they search to unify their civilization.","The second principle of the Charter of the United
Nations is to develop friendly relations among nations
based on respect for the principle of the equal rights
and self-determination of peoples, and to take other
appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.
Saint Lucia, as a small State in a hemisphere of both
small and large States, emphasizes the use of diplomacy
as a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized
relations. We note the increasing mutual involvement
of the peoples on both sides of the China Strait and
express the hope that that will lead to normal relations
beneficial to all the peoples of the world. In that regard,
we welcome the response of the membership of the
International Civil Aviation Organization to embrace
the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in aspects of its proceedings. That can be an appropriate
model for the further engagement of Taiwan in the
activities of international organizations, thus permitting
that country to play its role more effectively in global
development.","In that connection I would refer, as I did on behalf
of the Government of Saint Lucia last year, to the
participation of Taiwan in international organizations,
particularly those that focus on technical arrangements
or the resolution of important issues that are of
value to the international system as a whole or to its
member States. My country again makes a plea for
fuller participation by Taiwan, particularly in the
World Health Organization and the International Civil
Aviation Organization. Taiwan has the experience
of engaging in a technological revolution that has
enhanced its economic development and the welfare of
its people, and in many respects that State has become
a viable economic development model for small States.
Hence we believe that the Government and people of
Taiwan have much to offer developing countries, and so
we would support any institutional initiative that would
allow that country to make a contribution through those
mechanisms of the United Nations that are devoted
to solutions to issues of technological, economic and
social development.","The Government of Saint Lucia, which has official
relations with the Government of the Republic of China
on Taiwan, notes the continuing interchange between
that State and the People’s Republic of China, which
is defined in particular by the economic relations in which they are mutually involved. We believe tha,t as
we retain the status quo of accrediting recognition to
Taiwan, it is not for us but for themselves to indicate
the appropriate template in the relations between the
two countries.",,"We have also been very fortunate to receive
support from friends near and far as we seek to make
a better world for those who will follow us. In our
case, friendships like those that we have with Taiwan,
Cuba and Mexico, among others, allow us to envision
a positive future. I ask that, while we may come from
different places and with different priorities, we must
never forget that we share a common future — a
future that will be secure only if we meet the threats,
challenges and opportunities that confront us together,
with greater cooperation and understanding.","We must be willing to challenge discrimination
and exclusion if we hope to create an equal and just
world for all. Every country has a role to play in this
global environment. We know that. Saint Lucia joins
the other voices calling for an end to the more than
half-a-century-old embargo imposed on our neighbour
Cuba, and to all restrictions on the rights of the Cuban
people, particularly regarding liberty, security and
advancement. Similarly, we call for an end to the
restrictions on the legitimate aspirations of Taiwan
to participate as an observer in key international
institutions, such as the World Health Organization,
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). We demand that as much for us
as for them.","Last April, the Foreign Ministers of the Group of
Seven (G-7) expressed their support for the substantive participation of Taiwan as an active member of the
international aviation community in forums of the
International Civil Aviation Organization. Saint Lucia
endorses that call, as we believe that the exclusion of
active members for political purposes compromises
aviation safety and security. The G-7 has now added its
voice to those that have long advocated for the inclusion
of Taiwan in the work of the global community.","It is time to, once again, give states like Taiwan recognition so that they can
meaningfully engage in global processes and share their best practices. Even as China
and Taiwan have their own differences and while this is being addressed, Climate
Change and the COVID-19 pandemic are stark reminders that Taiwan should not be
left out of the discussions. Taiwan has its own elections, its own currency, controls
its own airspace and has its own military force. A population of almost 24 million
people is too many to be left off the table.
As we mark 75 years, the continued exclusion of Taiwan, calls into question
the very principles the UN was established on. We must also recognize that as the
world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic Taiwan has demonstrated impressive
leadership, not just by their own success with managing the spread, but by coming to
the aid of nations such as Saint Lucia and many other countries to provide medical
resources and technical advice. The pandemic which has touched every country is a
potent reminder of the interconnectedness of human societies and more reason why
in building our new world economic order, we must leave no one behind, no people,
no country should be allowed to fall through the cracks."
Samoa,,,,,,,"We are also a country which cherishes the United
Nations Charter and the fundamental principles for which
our Organization stands. This is the basis for our support of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People’s
Republic of China.",,,"In the coming year, as we move towards an agreed
approach to the Millennium Assembly, my Government
believes that the world community should focus on major
global challenges likely to confront humankind in the next
century. We agree with the Secretary-General that,
alongside war and conflicts, natural disasters are a major
and priority global challenge. Natural disasters remain a
most serious threat to human lives and national
economies. As we have seen in recent times, natural
disasters occur widely and indiscriminately, not stopping
at any border. At this moment, we think especially of
communities whose lives and property have been affected
in Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, the United States and the
Bahamas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
São Tomé and Príncipe,,,,,,,,,"I would like to call attention to resolution 2758
(XXVI), adopted in 1971, which denied over 21.8 million
people their right to international representation and totally
contravenes the principle of universality, consecrated in the
Charter. The admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan
as one of our own would not pose a challenge to any of the
existing Members, and the peaceful coexistence of the two
sides in this Organization would be a catalyst to end one of
the largest and most enduring sources of instability in Asia.
Taking into consideration this and the changes that have taken place in international relations, we call on the
General Assembly to review resolution 2758 (XXVI).",,,"Today more than ever before, it is obvious that
we need to change the working methods of the organs
of the United Nations so that they can better respond to
the demands of the day. As a universal organization,
the United Nations must be open to all States. Here we
are talking about international law, the sovereign
conduct of relations with other States, and active
participation, in a spirit of solidarity, in development
efforts through cooperation and international trade
relationships. That certainly applies to the Republic of
China on Taiwan. We believe in the right to disagree,
especially when disagreement is democratically
expressed by people. We also believe that dialogue is
the only way to ease tension wherever it is most acute.","I would now like to draw the attention of the
General Assembly to the following situation. We are
today congratulating two countries on their entry as full
members of the United Nations. But the task of
achieving universalism in the United Nations has,
unfortunately, still not been completed. I take this
opportunity to pay special tribute to another country,
with a population of more than 20 million inhabitants,
which has achieved admirable economic and social
progress through democracy, but which the
international community continues to fail to recognize
as an independent and sovereign nation. I am referring
to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Sao Tome and
Principe hopes, and urges, the Organization of United
Nations to resolve this case soon as a matter of justice
and to declare and accept Taiwan as an independent
and sovereign nation.","Mr. President, my country would once again ask
for your attention with respect to the Republic of China
on Taiwan. This is a country with a democratically
elected Government which has built a strong economy
and which has strong ties with many Member States. Taiwan was recently affected by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), but it was beyond the
reach of the World Health Organization because
Taiwan is not allowed to be a member — simply
because Taiwan’s people do not accept the imposition
of the “one China” principle.
Despite its small size, Taiwan offers development
aid to a large number of countries. Taiwan also
contributes to international security by being a strong
proponent of the fight against terrorism.
I wish to call to the attention of the Assembly
that, under the universality rules set out in the Charter
of the United Nations, the Republic of China on
Taiwan must one day be here among us.","The universality of the Organization must be a fact,
and all countries have to be represented. Taiwan is not
represented. We call upon the international community
to address the issue of Taiwan’s representation. Despite
its small size, Taiwan offers development aid to a large
number of countries. Taiwan has all the elements to be an
active member of the main international organizations. A
look at its economy, trade relations, commerce,
finance, application of new technologies and support
for many countries reveals facts that we cannot ignore
any longer.","The universality of the Organization requires that
all nations must be represented. However, this
continues not to be so despite several calls for it. As we
reflect on reforming the United Nations, we must once
again take advantage of the opportunity from this
rostrum to invite the international community to review
the problem of the need for the Republic of China on
Taiwan to be represented in the Organization. In this
regard, my country signed the letter contained in
document A/60/192 requesting the inclusion of an item
in the agenda of the present session entitled “Question
of the representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations”. Once again, we have
lost an opportunity to correct this injustice.
 We are further concerned by the recent adoption
by the People’s Republic of China of the so-called antisecession law, which, by increasing tension in the
Strait of Taiwan, may compromise peace in the region.
Aware of the role of the United Nations, specifically
under the provisions of Articles 1 and 34 of the
Charter, Sao Tome and Principe also joined in
proposing the draft resolution annexed to document
A/60/193. That document contains a letter requesting
the inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of
the present session entitled, “A proactive role for the
United Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait”. Neither proposal received the expected support.","I cannot continue without again asking the
Assembly why a country of 23 million people is not
represented at the United Nations, where every country
is supposed to have one vote. I refer here to Taiwan, an
established democracy whose people live in freedom
and in peace. Their dynamic and technologically
advanced economy is a model for creating wealth in
today’s global economy. Taiwan is also an excellent
world citizen, generous in humanitarian and
development aid.
 For centuries, the people of Sao Tome and
Principe were debilitated by endemic malaria, and
thousands died. Countless attempts to control the
mosquitoes carrying that disease failed, until Taiwan
brought the necessary know-how and resources to bear.
Today cases of malaria have been reduced by 60 per
cent. Our doctors and nurses say that there have never
been so few cases of malaria in living memory. Thanks
to Taiwan and also to the Global Fund to Fight
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, we are well on
our way to finally bringing this scourge under control.
 In addition to humanitarian and development aid,
Taiwan also maintains productive commercial ties with
many United Nations Member countries and is a
member of the World Trade Organization, the Asian
Development Bank and the Asia Pacific Economic
Group. The principle of universality is consecrated in
the United Nations Charter. Permanent members of the
Security Council should not continue to ignore the case
of Taiwan. ","We are grateful for aid. My people would suffer
even more than they already do without the World
Food Programme, for example. The World Health
Organization and the Global Fund to fight tuberculosis
and malaria are working with us very well. The
Republic of Taiwan, the people of the island of
Formosa, with their well-known generosity and special
attention to our realities, have been crucial in our own
success against malaria. Many organizations and
individuals have worked with us for many years with
open hearts and generous spirits, and we thank them all
for that. One of those situations is the issue of Taiwan.
There are 23 million people living on Formosa island,
also called Taiwan. They do not ask the international
community to help them because they are poor. On the
contrary, they are one of the main recognized world
economic powers, and they are helping other countries,
such as Sao Tome and Principe. They only ask to be
recognized as a sovereign country and to be included
as such on the lists of the United Nations and its
agencies. This is a question of justice. ","Speaking of solidarity and Taiwan, once again
from this rostrum, I would like to appeal to the
conscience of each and every member to consider the
fate to which 23 million Taiwanese have been
relegated. Will the community of nations represented
here continue to ignore the existence of a population
comprising more than 23 million people? I must
remind the Assembly that the Republic of China on
Taiwan is a country with a vibrant democracy and an
enviable economic and technological record that has
served as a development model for the global economy.
On 20 May 2008, we were pleased to see the
inauguration of the new President of that friendly
country. We paid close attention to his inaugural
address, which was a genuine call for peace and good
relations in the Taiwan Strait. ","Despite everything, there are positive signs on the
international scene, for which we are grateful. We
welcome the recent positive developments between the
Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China. We continue to support increased
participation at the United Nations for the Republic of
China on Taiwan. In that regard, we welcome the
admission of that nation of 23 million people as an
observer at the World Health Organization. We hope
that other United Nations agencies, such as the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
and the International Civil Aviation Organization, can
also take advantage of the valuable contributions that
that developed country can make with respect to the
urgent needs of the Organization.
 Unfortunately, however, while we can express a
certain satisfaction concerning the issue of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, we cannot do so with
regard to the trade embargo against Cuba; indeed, we
are greatly disappointed in that area. But we dare to
remain hopeful that the new United States
Administration will have the courage and
determination to shortly address this issue in the same
manner as it has dealt with that of Guantánamo. ","I would be remiss if I concluded my statement
without addressing the situation along the Taiwan
Strait. We recognize the efforts made by both sides
along the Strait aimed at reducing political tension and
creating a favourable climate that is conducive to
peace, security and development in the region. Despite
those positive developments — including the signing
of an economic treaty regulating trade relations
between the two sides, opening up airspace to
commercial traffic and promoting stronger links between the two peoples — there are still some aspects
that must be addressed in order to allow greater
involvement by Taiwan in the international community.
 We call on Members of the United Nations, and
in particular its specialized agencies, to find ways to
make possible Taiwan’s greater participation in
specialized agencies and other bodies and machinery,
such as the International Civil Aviation Organization
and the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change. We believe that Taiwan’s participation
in those two forums will strengthen both those
mechanisms and better serve our common interests. ","Taking into account that has Taiwan not only
enormous potential, but also a population of around
23 million people, its participation in United Nations
specialized agencies, as has been the case since 2009
with respect to the World Health Assembly, could make
a substantial contribution to the international
community. In this regard, we urge the relevant United
Nations bodies to seek ways and means to ensure the
participation of Taiwan in some of the mechanisms and
agencies of the United Nations system, in particular the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. ","We are pleased to note a few positive signs in the
dialogue between the Republic of China on Taiwan
and the People’s Republic of China on the one hand,
and, on the other, the willingness of the United States
Congress and the European Parliament to admit Taiwan
as a member of international organizations. Sao Tome
and Principe supports initiatives such as these, which
will make it possible for the people of Taiwan to make a
significant contribution to international issues without
ignoring the necessity for the two parties in the Straits
of Formosa to work peacefully to agree to frame and
normalize their relations.","We also acknowledge the climate of constructive
dialogue between Taiwan and the People’s Republic
of China, which serves to send a positive signal that
tensions are decreasing in the region, which we welcome
and encourage. Both parties along the Formosa Strait
must work peacefully towards reaching an agreement
on the normalization of their relations. For our part, we
continue to support the integration of Taiwan within
international organizations.","Before I finish my statement, please allow me
to note the situation of calm and progress between
the two sides on the Taiwan Strait. We welcome that
environment and encourage the parties to develop their
relations through negotiations. Our country is pleased
to see the participation of the Republic of China on
Taiwan in the General Assembly of the World Health
Organization and applauds the fact that Taiwan was
invited, for the first time since 1971, to participate
in the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation
Organization in 2013.
Therefore, and considering the enormous potential
of Taiwan, we would like to see its participation
further extend to other specialized agencies of
the United Nations, such as the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to the
implementation process of the post-2015 development
agenda, in which it could be of significant help to the
international community.","In conclusion, we must acknowledge and welcome
the political progress achieved by both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, with a clear reduction of tensions,
ever greater openness and broad trade exchanges.
In addition, given Taiwan’s manifold potential, we
recommend that Taiwan participate in the United
Nations specialized agencies, as it already does in the
World Health Organization.",,"In that regard, I would like to remind the Assembly
that, based on the recognition of the One China
principle, the Government of the Democratic Republic
of Sao Tome and Principe re-established diplomatic
ties with the People’s Republic of China late last year.
We are certain that this decision will help to strengthen
our strategic partnership, and we hope that China will
accompany us on the difficult path to development that
we have proposed with our transformation agenda 2030.",,,
Senegal,,,,,,,"Guided by the ideal of the universality of the United
Nations, Senegal supports the request of the Republic of
China to be admitted to membership in our Organization,
and, generally speaking, to membership in the specialized
agencies of the United Nations system. It is inarguable, in
our opinion, that that State, in view of its socio-economic
performance, its development level, its commitment to
democratic values and its behaviour in international
affairs meets all the criteria and conditions set forth by
the Charter of the United Nations for admission to
membership. This admission to membership, should it
occur, would make an important contribution to
stabilizing international relations in that part of Asia and
would allow for an unprecedented economic, technical
and cultural cooperation among the countries of SouthEast Asia and Africa. Its admission would in no way
jeopardize the efforts made by the international
community for peace and development in the world.","The universal nature of the United Nations is a
reality that must be consolidated and strengthened. In this
context, we support without reservation the request of the
Republic of China to join again the community of nations
and be admitted to our Organization and its specialized
agencies. Acceding to this request would be a significant
contribution to the consolidation of the ideal of
universality of the United Nations and do justice to the
esteemed people of the Republic of China. Its economic
and social development, commitment to democratic values
and international behaviour have given irrefutable proof
of its faith in the noble objectives of the United Nations
Charter and of its capacity to assume the responsibilities
of all Member States.
When the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989, great hope
was aroused in the citizens of the world. Hope was born
of rapid movement towards a new international order
which would bring with it peace and justice as well as
solidarity and progress. In this new international order,
the Republic of China has a place, a place recognized by
international law and the demands of a rapidly developing
world.","In keeping with this principle, Senegal unreservedly
supports the request by the Republic of China to rejoin
the community of free nations and to be admitted as a
member of our Organization and of its specialized
agencies. Accordingly, we have proposed that the General
Assembly reconsider that part of resolution 2758 (XXVI)
that excluded the Republic of China from the United
Nations and from its specialized agencies.","Allow me to use the idea of universality to explain
and justify, if that is necessary, my country's unreserved
support for the admission of the Republic of China, with its
22 million inhabitants, as a full Member of the United
Nations and its specialized agencies. The Republic of
China — a democratic country concerned with safeguarding
and promoting human rights, a world economic Power
recognized by nations, and, last but not least, a nation that
maintains trade relations through commercial delegations —
shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble
ideals of peace, solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the
Charter. That country, for the sake of the principle of the
universality of our Organization, should take its place once
more. Simple justice requires this, and the ideals embodied
in our Charter dictate it, because it is in the name of these
principles that other States are admitted as Members of this
Organization, which I welcome.","It is in the name of rapprochement between
peoples and the principle of universality that my
country supports the request of the Republic of China
on Taiwan to rejoin the concert of free nations within
the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and
thus to participate in the consolidation of international
peace and security.","In view of the universality which is the hallmark
of the United Nations and which was reaffirmed at the
Millennium Summit, Senegal firmly supports the
legitimate request of the Republic of China on Taiwan
to resume its seat in the Organization and in its
specialized agencies. That request is not directed
against any State Member of the United Nations; meeting
it would be a key contribution to consolidating the
ideal of the universality of the United Nations and to
the advent of an era of peace and stability in that
sensitive part of the world.","It is precisely in the name of the principle of the
universality of the United Nations that Senegal
reiterates its fervent wish to see the Republic of China
on Taiwan join the concert of nations and assume its
full responsibilities in our Organization and its
specialized agencies. Granting that request, following
the good precedent of the World Trade Organization,
would bring justice to the 23 million inhabitants of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, who through their
exemplary conduct on the world stage have already
given proof of Taipeiís attachment to the noble
objectives of the San Francisco Charter.","It is precisely in the name of those shared ideals
that my country, Senegal, reaffirms once again its
fervent support for the readmission of the Republic of
China on Taiwan as a full-fledged Member of the
United Nations. By doing that ó without calling into
question the participation and the legitimate status of
any other Member of the great United Nations
family ó we would do justice to that countryís 23
million hard-working and disciplined inhabitants,
deeply attached to the values of peace, freedom and
democracy enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations.","As I extol universality, I feel it is unfair that the
Republic of China on Taiwan, with its 23 million
inhabitants, its major democratic system and its
impressive economic vitality, would still be sidelined
from the work of the United Nations, whose Charter
does rightly enshrine the essential principles of justice
and universality.","In advocating justice, it seems inconceivable that
the Republic of China on Taiwan, with its 23 million
inhabitants and its impressive economic dynamism,
should be kept out of the United Nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Singapore,,,,"China and Taiwan held direct informal talks in
Singapore and Beijing this year. They will continue their
own dialogue at their own pace. They should be encouraged
to build confidence by working together, as they already
have in the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) and as they hope to
do in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).",,,,,,,,,,,"Moreover, the international community should
not allow the deteriorating relationship across the
Taiwan Straits to spin out of control. The push towards
independence by certain groups on Taiwan is most
dangerous, because it will lead to war with mainland
China and will drag in other countries. The stability of
the entire Asia-Pacific region is at stake. Not many
years ago, the relationship between the mainland and
Taiwan was much better. In 1991, Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) — a grouping of economies around
the Pacific Ocean — admitted China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong on the basis of certain agreed principles. At an
APEC meeting in 1992, I remember joining the Trade
Ministers of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong for a
relaxed lunch in Bangkok. Later, in 1993, representatives from China and Taiwan met in Singapore
for informal talks, with both sides acknowledging, “One
China: to each its own interpretation”.
All problems seemed soluble then. But, in 1994,
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a shocking
interview to a Japanese magazine, describing himself
as a Moses leading his people out of Egypt. From then
on, cross-straits relations went from bad to worse as
pro-independence forces on Taiwan became
increasingly adventurous. As in the Middle East, the
international community has a strong vested interest in
supporting a peaceful resolution of cross-straits
conflict, based on the “one China” position that was
adopted and settled by the United Nations in 1971.",,,,"The relaxation of tensions across the Taiwan
Straits in the past few months serves as a positive
example of how intractable problems from the past can
be creatively transcended with wisdom, goodwill and
patience. Sometimes impatience is its own worst
enemy. After 90 years, the collapse of the Ottoman
Empire has left some problems still unresolved in parts
of its former domain. We cannot expect all the issues
thrown up by the end of the cold war and the break-up
of the Soviet Union to be quickly overcome. What we
know is that, without the United Nations setting
acceptable norms of behaviour, there will be many
more problems in the world and some of the problems we now face will become far worse. Universally agreed
human rights are important precisely because they
underpin those norms of good behaviour. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Solomon Islands,,,,"The United Nations is a strong supporter of peace.
This noble world body has, to date, supported the
reunification of the two Germanys and of the two Koreas.
In this context, reunification means only one thing - the
uniting of people. Unification means peace and coexistence.
Conflicts in areas around the world should be resolved
through dialogue. Thus, we believe that the United Nations
mechanism that was used in the case of Germany and in the
case of the two Koreas should be applied to the situation
involving the Republic of China and the People’s Republic
of China.
Solomon Islands recognizes the need for reunification
of the two Chinas through good will and in good faith. We
call on both to hold talks, on equal terms, on the basis of
this important United Nations principle. But the process can
be successful only if this world body considers the
exceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in
the international context, based on the principle of
universality of membership and in accordance with the
established model of parallel representation of divided
countries at the United Nations.
Solomon Islands fully recognizes and strongly supports
the wish of the people of the Republic of China to rejoin the
United Nations. As a small, friendly nation with a
population of only about 300,000, Solomon Islands firmly
believes that the desire of the 21 million people of the
Republic of China in Taiwan for their own representation in
this world body is reasonable and justified. We are sure that
the international community would benefit from the positive
contribution that the Republic of China is capable of making
to this Organization. Our own country has benefited, in the
past 10 years, from the economic development and
technological progress that the people of the Republic of
China have secured through achieving for their country such
a high position in the league of the industrialized nations.
Solomon Islands therefore supports the call from other Member States for the establishment of an ad hoc committee
to examine the question of the Republic of China rejoining
the United Nations.","We in Solomon Islands firmly believe that the
Republic of China on Taiwan has much to contribute to the
work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in
terms of international cooperation and development. This
Republic, with a population more than 58 times that of my
own country and highly technologically advanced, deserves
to be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. The
full participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
important work of the United Nations would be an
affirmation of the Charter and of democracy and a
manifestation of the human spirit’s pursuit of a better
quality of life for humankind. In my Government’s view,
a move as noble as the admission of the Republic of China
on Taiwan would be not an obstacle to reunification, but a
catalyst in the process. In our view, the Secretary-General
should use his good offices to encourage the establishment
of a committee specifically to facilitate and/or work
progressively towards the re-entry of the Republic of China
to membership of the United Nations.","Committed to democracy and tolerance, Solomon
Islands calls for renewed consideration of the exceptional
situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
international context, on the basis of the principle of
universality and in accordance with the established model
of parallel representation of divided countries at the
United Nations. The Republic of China’s standing as the
fifteenth largest trading nation in the world, with the
twentieth highest gross national product and the largest
foreign-exchange holdings, its continuing assistance to
many developing countries and its efforts to strengthen
international economic cooperation are obvious and
cannot be ignored by the world’s highest forum. In
addition, the Republic of China’s contribution to world
peace and its unfailing support of United Nations
activities are undeniable evidence of its qualifications to
receive proper consideration for having a seat at the
United Nations. Solomon Islands therefore calls for a
renewed focus on the issue of readmitting the Republic of
China as a Member of the United Nations.","We and others spoke out on behalf of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, which, barred from the United Nations
and seeking unification with the People’s Republic of
China, is attempting to enlarge its contribution to the
developing world through this Organization. Solomon
Islands hopes that unification negotiations based on the
proposals each party has put forward can begin in the near
future.","Embracing the purposes and principles of the Charter,
Solomon Islands has on several occasions at the United
Nations called upon the Republic of China on Taiwan and
the People’s Republic of China to take the necessary steps
towards opening negotiations to achieve reunification. The
Government of the Republic of China is committed to the
peaceful and equitable reunification of China. Peaceful
reunification is also the stated goal of the People’s Republic
of China. Both parties have offered strikingly similar
proposals. Yet there has been no decisive movement
towards negotiation. Delay makes them ever harder to
initiate, increases tension across the Taiwan Strait and
threatens international peace and security. Responsibility for
peaceful reunification rests with the two parties and the
international community. Bringing about and successfully
completing negotiations will be a long and difficult process
that would be greatly assisted by the participation of the
Republic of China in the United Nations. The Republic of
China, which is fully committed to the purposes and
principles of the Charter, has the means to be an active
contributor to the Organization’s work.
Regrettably, threats have been made and actions taken
against Solomon Islands and other Member States that have
spoken on behalf of the Republic of China. Even the use of
force against us has been threatened, in violation of the
Charter’s principles and the letter and spirit of numerous
General Assembly resolutions. Threats have no place at the
United Nations.","We call once again for the representation and
participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
United Nations and its agencies. When the General
Assembly refuses to place this matter on its agenda, it
denies to the nearly 22 million people of Taiwan their
rights under the Charter of this Organization. It rejects the
opportunity to foster peace and security in the Taiwan
Strait through dialogue here at the United Nations. It turns
its back on preventive diplomacy. Surely the General
Assembly is better than this. The people of this politically
stable, economically strong and technologically advanced
democracy have amply demonstrated how much they have
to offer their region and the world. With the new
millennium nearly upon us, it is time to discard old
patterns of thought if the Chinese motherland is to reunite
peacefully. My Government will continue to appeal to the United Nations to seriously consider and recognize the
legitimate right of the people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to have a voice in this international arena.","At this juncture, let me renew the support of the
Solomon Islands for the appeal of the 22 million people
of the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented in
the United Nations and its related organizations. Taiwan
is capable of and willing to fulfil the obligations
contained in the Charter of the United Nations. Its
outstanding economic success has enabled it to play a
positive role in promoting world trade and in eradicating
poverty. It has rendered development assistance, including
technical training and technology transfer, to developing
countries, including my own. It has responded to United
Nations appeals for emergency relief and rehabilitation
assistance to countries that have suffered from natural
disasters and wars.
Regarding the accomplishments of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, are these not sufficient to merit
diplomatic recognition from the international community?
Taiwan's membership in the United Nations system would
contribute substantially to the security and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region and of the world in general. It would
also provide an effective basis for peaceful dialogue. The
process of self-realization, supported by the United
Nations, has resulted in the membership of North and
South Korea in the United Nations. The United Nations
ought to give similar consideration to the question of
Taiwan. Ideally, the membership of the Republic of China
on Taiwan, together with the People's Republic of China,
will make a stronger United Nations. The Solomon
Islands would welcome the opportunity to work through
the United Nations system to achieve a peaceful and just
resolution.","May I take this opportunity to reiterate the point
made by Solomon Islands during the Millennium
Summit relating to the principle of an all-inclusive and
universal United Nations. A case in point is that which
relates to the reunification of China, which would
foster greater stability in world affairs and effectively
bolster the activities of the Organization. This new
approach by the United Nations for the two Chinas will
enhance greater understanding in pragmatic diplomacy
and pave the way for efforts currently under way in the
Korean peninsula. This is not impossible to achieve, as
we saw just before the turn of the century in the
reunification of the two Germanys.","In what is surely one of the bitter ironies of our
times, free and democratic Taiwan, home to 23 million
people and a peace-loving country, has been excluded
not only from the United Nations and all its specialized
agencies but also from nearly every other
intergovernmental organization in the world. Although
the Republic of China on Taiwan willingly abides by
international norms, standards and obligations, it is not
able to enjoy the same normal standard privileges and
treatment accorded to others. This is simply unfair and
unjust. The time has come to reconsider the exclusion
of the Republic of China from the United Nations. The
Republic of China on Taiwan was a founding member
of the Organization. It is a model of economic success
and democratic politics. Taiwan has continued to share
its development experiences with the wider
international community when given the opportunity.
Its continuing assistance during humanitarian crises
also deserves full commendation.
Solomon Islands’ appeal for Taiwan’s
representation and participation in the United Nations
system is premised on the principles of justice, dignity
and the right of the people of Taiwan to be heard and
represented in the international arena and for them to
be able to enjoy the same benefits that the rest of us
enjoy. My Government firmly believes that Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations will effectively
serve to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the two
Chinas and provide a solid basis for a lasting
reconciliation between them. Dialogue is the only
means to resolve differences, and parity and mutual
respect must be the foundation upon which both sides
can build trust and confidence. The United Nations is
the best forum to nurture that trust and confidence. The
issue of Taiwan’s membership is consistent with the
United Nations principle of universality. But, above all,
it must be acknowledged that the Republic of China on
Taiwan is fully committed to fulfilling the obligations
of the United Nations Charter.","Solomon Islands once again calls upon the United
Nations to respect the expressed wish of the
Government and the people of the Republic of China to
be readmitted as a full and equal member of this
Organization. The world has marvelled at Taiwanís
economic transformation. Within a short span of time,
it has not only established a stable and vibrant
domestic economy, but also has become one of the
worldís most influential economies in terms of
international trade, investment outflows and
information technology. Taiwan is a sovereign country
in full control of its own affairs and with influence in
the world economy, and it is unjust to deny its people
the right to stand tall and be counted among the many
nations represented in international institutions.
Taiwan is a willing and able country, ready to
shoulder the obligations of the United Nations and
other international organizations. Taiwan has proved
itself through its international economic cooperation
with many developing and least developed countries.
Solomon Islands is convinced that that there are no
legal barriers to Taiwanís membership in the United
Nations, only political obstacles. Let us therefore cast
aside those political obstacles and take a positive
approach by according the Government and the people
of the Republic of China the membership they deserve
and the opportunity to fully participate in the affairs of
the United Nations under its Charter.","Allow me at this juncture to express once more
our strong support for Taiwan to be admitted as a full
member of the United Nations. It is an undeniable fact
that under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign
state. It has a transparent and democratic political
system, a vibrant and progressive economy and a
highly efficient social system, all of which are
completely independent with no control whatsoever
exercised by the People’s Republic of China.
Taiwan is a willing partner, able to meet its
international obligations under the Charter. Its
contribution to the international community and the
global economy are well known. Yet only a fortnight
ago, this body once again denied the wishes of the
people of Taiwan to be considered for membership in
the United Nations. Over the years the international
community has discriminated against its 23 million
people. The delayed World Health Organization assistance to Taiwan during the outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome early this year is an
example of how reasons of power politics prevail over
timely humanitarian assistance.","One of the principles of the United Nations
Charter is to open membership to all States that accept
their Charter obligations. The Republic of China on
Taiwan has registered its interest in being part of the
United Nations family. Solomon Islands once again
calls for the Republic of China to be made a full
Member of the United Nations. Solomon Islands
enjoys warm and cordial relations with the Republic of
China and is mindful of the threats facing the world
today. Threats such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) are transnational and transborder in
nature and require the cooperation and engagement of
all countries of the world. To deny one country the right to participate weakens global mechanisms and
jeopardizes the security of all.
The Republic of China on Taiwan is democratic,
and its vibrant economy is ranked seventeenth globally.
It has the third largest foreign exchange reserves. Its
development experience offers important lessons on
the need to embrace freedom, respect for the basic
principles of human rights, respect for freedom of the
press and the uninhibited functioning of democratic
institutions. The Republic of China’s ability and
capacity to contribute to strengthening the United
Nations should be seriously considered, especially at a
time when the Organization could do with all the help
it can receive.
Solomon Islands calls upon the Assembly to find
a process that will allow the Republic of China on
Taiwan to become a full and equal Member of the
United Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum has a
mechanism that engages both Chinas in our dialogue
process, and we have continuously benefited from that
rich interaction.","The United Nations was founded on the principle
of maintaining international peace and security. Over
the years, some threats continue to receive more
attention than others. The Anti-Secession Law enacted
by the People’s Republic of China in March this year
has threatened peace and security on the Taiwan Strait.
The situation creates a security vacuum that, if left
unattended, will continue to fester and will put in
question the credibility of this premier multilateral
institution. There is no mechanism to address such threats
within the parameters of the United Nations Charter.
Solomon Islands therefore renews its call to have
the issue debated in the General Assembly. The time has now come for this body to allow Taiwan, a major
player in the international economic system, to take its
rightful place in the United Nations. The Assembly
cannot continue to ignore the plight of the 23 million
people of Taiwan. Solomon Islands regrets the manner
in which the Assembly has dealt with the issue,
allowing certain countries to dictate the agenda.","On the question of the representation of Taiwan,
the continuous refusal by this Organization over the
past 13 years to discuss the representation of the 23
million people of Taiwan at the United Nations is a
matter of serious concern. This creates an institutional
gap in an Organization where we are all supposed to
stand equal. My delegation wishes to register its
disappointment at the fact that its right even to discuss
the issue was denied last week. Solomon Islands feels
that the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter continue to be violated in this respect. The
time has come for this institution to act according to
the rules that guide the behaviour and conduct of
Members and to have an honest debate on the issue.
Solomon Islands renews its call on the United Nations to recognize the right of the 23 million people of
Taiwan to be represented at the United Nations.
Solomon Islands is also concerned about security
threats on the Taiwan Strait. My delegation calls on all
Member States to distinguish our collective interests to
preserve peace from narrow interests that threaten
peace. Solomon Islands further calls on the United
Nations, the body responsible for the maintenance of
international peace and security, to mediate and engage
with the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan and other
stakeholders in finding a permanent solution to this
issue. "," Moving from the preoccupations of the past year
to our perennial protestations, Solomon Islands is
compelled by principle, rather than pragmatism, to
ventilate again our people’s concerns arising from the
non-representation of the Government and people of
Taiwan in this Assembly. Our recent attempts to
channel Taiwan’s application for admission through the
established gateways was resisted — without any
regard for the legitimate quest of 23 million Taiwanese
people for self-determination — by fellow Member
States committed to upholding a peremptory rule of
international law also enshrined in Article 1 of the
Charter of the United Nations. Organized international
hypocrisy is the only basis for explaining the indignity
that the Taiwanese people must suffer at the hands of a
powerful constellation of States interested only in the
protection of trade and investment and not any
humanitarian concerns.  China’s assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan
must be the pretence that it invariably is, since most of
its major trading partners have also forged and
maintain bilateral relations with Taiwan, which are
ultimately predicated on politico-juridical autonomy.
Solomon Islanders have a native empathy for all people
who are struggling to reclaim what is rightfully due to
them under international law. Our support for their
struggle stems from our convictions about what is right
and just. Our sovereign conscience is not a tradable
commodity. Our rejection of regular approaches for the
reconsideration of our existing allegiances to Taiwan is
premised on our preference, ideally, to recognize both
China and Taiwan on a realistic rather than an
imaginary politico-juridical footing.
 This Assembly is the forum in which mutual
respect and goodwill prevail and enable us to implore China, as one of the oldest civilizations of our world,
to pledge its non-resort to force in settling the disputed
question of its sovereignty over Taiwan.
 As one of Taiwan’s long-standing diplomatic
allies, and undeterred by the result recently engineered
by international political pragmatism, Solomon Islands
cannot shirk its Charter obligations under Article 35,
paragraph 1, to bring to the attention of this Assembly
the situation currently prevailing between Taiwan and
China. The situation is clearly of a nature requiring
investigation by the Security Council, pursuant to
Article 34, on the basis that it “might lead to
international friction or give rise to a dispute”. The
Security Council is obliged to investigate the situation
in order to determine whether the continuance thereof
is likely to endanger the maintenance of international
peace and security. ","Solomon Islands calls on the international
community to recognize the Republic of China on
Taiwan’s good faith and build on the positive
momentum. The international community must provide
the Republic of China on Taiwan with the necessary
and appropriate international space if we are to be
responsible and contribute to the maintenance of
international peace, stability and security along the
Taiwan Strait. ","Before I say anything about Taiwan’s cross-Strait
relations, Solomon Islands conveys its sympathy and
embraces the pain and suffering of all those impacted
by typhoon Morakot. We also acknowledge the spirit
and strength of the Government and people of the
Republic of China in rising above that tragedy with
resilience to rebuild their lives and recover from the
natural catastrophe.
 My country continues to follow cross-Strait
developments with deep interest. A new era of relations is emerging between the Republic of China and the
People’s Republic of China. Relations have been
marked by an increased series of engagements. Direct
flights, shipping, postal cooperation and exchanges on
food safety, inter alia, have been initiated. This peoplecentred approach continues to build bridges of trust,
tolerance and confidence. We wish this positive
interaction every success.
 Earlier this year, my delegation was encouraged
to witness Taiwan’s admission as an observer to the
World Health Assembly. We hope with all sincerity that
similar overtures will be accorded to Taiwan by other
specialized entities within the United Nations system. ","Solomon Islands is encouraged by the further
growth of positive developments and engagements
with regard to the Taiwan Strait. That must be
internationally recognized, commended and supported.
The moderate and pragmatic path adopted by both the
People’s Republic of China and Taiwan about the
Taiwan Strait contributes to international peace and
security.
 Solomon Islands continues to support Taiwan’s
meaningful participation within the United Nations
system. My delegation is heartened to note Taiwan’s
participation as an observer at the World Health
Assembly in both 2009 and 2010. That is a gesture of
the improved cross-Strait relations. Taiwan has
registered its interest in participating in two United
Nations treaty organizations this year: the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization. My country supports such participation.
The two organizations deal with two global issues that
are of common concern to all the world. Climate
change and aviation issues need the participation of all
countries for aviation safety and the health of our
atmosphere. My delegation finds it regrettable that the
UNFCCC secretariat has adopted a narrow position on
a matter that requires the parties to the Convention and
to the Kyoto Protocol to decide on. ","On Taiwan cross-strait relations, my delegation
continues to commend the ongoing dialogue between
the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China. We note Taiwan’s continuous
contributions to the global health system in terms of a
wide range of international development programmes,
and welcome its participation as an observer to the
World Health Assembly. We continue to call for such
arrangements to be extended to other United Nations
treaty bodies, including the United Nations Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the
meaningful participation of Taiwan and its people in
the affairs of the international community. Solomon
Islands also acknowledges Taiwan’s climate change
mitigation and renewable energy programmes with
developing countries, and would like to see the
application of similar observer arrangements extended
to Taiwan within the UNFCCC. ","My Government recognizes Taiwan’s flexible,
moderate and rational foreign policy, which continues
to promote friendly cross-Strait relations. Solomon
Islands continues to support Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the United Nations system, including its aspiration to be a member of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). Although not a member of ICAO, Taiwan
manages more than 1 million flights and 40 million
passengers per annum. Similarly, Taiwan is the twentysecond-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, but it is not
a member of UNFCCC. I firmly believe that it is our
shared responsibility to engage Taiwan in our efforts to
advance sustainable development and address climate
change.","On the question of the Republic of China, Solomon
Islands call for the Republic’s meaningful participation
at United Nations specialized organizations. We would
like to acknowledge the Republic of China’s recent
participation in the Assembly of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a guest of the
organization’s President. We recognize that as a first
step. We continue to seek observer status for the
Republic of China both at ICAO and at the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Those requests mirror the observer status that the
Republic of China currently enjoys at the World Health
Assembly.","One of the principles of the SDGs is that we
must not leave anyone behind. There are States
knocking at the door of the United Nations, ready to
take on multilateral responsibilities. The Republic of
China on Taiwan continues to seek full and effective
participation with three United Nations specialized
bodies, namely, the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO).
Those United Nations bodies deal with urgent
global issues in which we all have an interest — from
climate change to the evolving health challenges. ICAO
works to keep our travelling public and air services
safe. I wish to note that 45 million passengers passed
through the Republic of China, Taiwan, in 2012. We do not have the luxury of time to turn a blind eye to
the required cooperation. The global challenges before
us are too great for narrow interests to adopt a waitand-see approach and to keep postponing action that
is needed.
The Republic of China, Taiwan, is a country that
has transformed itself from a developing country into
an industrialized one. It is the twenty-seventh-largest
economy in the world and has experience, technology
and capability from which our shared agenda can
benefit. We have all to gain and nothing to lose by
inviting the Republic of China, Taiwan, to become the
195th member of the UNFCCC, the 192nd member of
ICAO and the 195th member of the WHO.","Solomon Islands, as a close friend of the Republic
of China/Taiwan, continues to call for the Republic
of China on Taiwan’s meaningful participation in our
United Nations specialized bodies. The Republic of
China on Taiwan continues to take on international
obligations with regard to climate change and aviation.
The Republic of China on Taiwan, which is among the
largest economies in the world, needs to be part of the
global solution in the various international frameworks.
The international community must welcome the interest
of the Republic of China on Taiwan in participating
fully as equals in the proceedings of the International
Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Solomon Islands has benefited from the
Republic of China or Taiwan’s partnership with us
on the Millennium Development Goals, and we will
enhance our bilateral cooperation with the Republic
of China on Taiwan under the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The
Sustainable Development Goals are universal in nature,
and we expect our friend and partner to join the world
in helping to eradicate poverty and to heal the declining
health of our planet.","Solomon Islands recognizes the fundamental
rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its
23 million people to participate meaningfully in the
United Nations specialized agencies. Solomon Islands
finds Taiwan’s limited and restricted participation with
the World Health Organization system regrettable,
especially at a time when the spread of infectious diseases is impacting our children, and we need
everyone to assist. We call for Taiwan’s open and free
access to all World Health Organization meetings.
Similarly, Taiwan remains unjustly on the fringes of
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
decision-making processes, Taiwan manages more
than 1 million flights, equalling 58 million passengers,
through the Taipei Flight Information Region. We also
call for Taiwan’s predictable and certain participation
in ICAO meetings. There have always been two
political systems along the Taiwan Strait. The reality is
that the world works with one and turns a blind eye to
the other. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development calls for all hands on deck.
Let us put the interests of humankind first and work
with all, including Taiwan.","However, as we in the Assembly speak of leaving
no one behind, we are at the same time shutting the
door for the people of Taiwan in participating in this
universal process. We are thereby contradicting our
own principles by leaving 23 million people behind.
And yet the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development requires global partnership
and the joint efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize
all available resources. Taiwan is ready, willing and
able to engage in and contribute to the wide range of
substantive United Nations programmes for the welfare
of humankind. If we are to focus on people and promote
peace and sustainability, let us give Taiwan and its
23 million people a chance.
Let us not contradict the principles that the United
Nations was established to represent and allow the rules
to change based on whose best interests are at stake.
Taiwan has been actively involved in United Nations
programmes and specialized agencies. Despite its
contributions to the well-being of the citizens of the
world, we continue to ignore Taiwan’s right to selfdetermination; as such, it is high time that the Assembly
gave due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member
of the family of nations.","While we speak of leaving no one behind, we still
close our doors to Taiwan and continue to contradict
our own principles by leaving Taiwan’s 23 million
people behind. The implementation of the Sustainable
Development Goals requires a unified global partnership.
Taiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in, and
contribute to, the wide range of substantive United
Nations programmes for the welfare of humankind.
Solomon Islands continues to call for the participation
of Taiwan in United Nations specialized bodies,
including the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, the World Health Organization and
the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan
is the twenty-second-largest economy in the world and,
as such, Taiwan should be part of global solutions in
the various international frameworks. I believe that
Taiwan has a lot to contribute through its experience
and technological capability. If we are to focus on
shared responsibility and promote peaceful, equitable
and sustainable societies, we should give Taiwan and its
23 million people a chance. Despite the contributions
made by Taiwan to the well-being of the citizens of the
globe, we continue to ignore the right of Taiwan to selfdetermination. The time has come for the Assembly to
give due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member
of the family of nations.","I also want to announce to the Assembly that
Solomon Islands has begun reviewing its foreign policy.
In so doing, we have recognized the One China policy,
in accordance with resolution 2758 (XXVI), and have
formalized our relations with the People’s Republic of
China. We are broadening our engagements with all
countries in keeping with our policy of “friends to all,
enemies to none”.",
St. Vincent and the Grenadines,,,,"Adherence to the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter and the right of the world’s peoples to selfdetermination are the main barometers used in the admission
of States to membership of this body of nations. However,
the Republic of China on Taiwan, a nation of over
21 million inhabitants, which today has one of the most
vigorous economies in the world, is excluded from
membership of the United Nations. In this post-cold-war
era, when a number of countries which once had a single
identity and representation in this Organization now find
ready admission as separate and sovereign members, it is
appropriate that all States capable of maintaining such
sovereign identity be so recognized. Moreover, the Republic
of China on Taiwan has demonstrated its capacity to be in
the forefront of world economic development and should be
provided with an opportunity to participate in, and contribute
to, the programmes of the United Nations.","It is the view of the delegation of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines that the time has come when serious
consideration should be given the eligibility of the Republic
of China in Taiwan to become a Member of the United
Nations. That is why my Government, in association with
other like-minded countries, requested the Secretary-General
to include an item on the agenda of the forty-ninth session
of the General Assembly entitled “Consideration of the
exceptional situation of the Republic of China in Taiwan in
the international context, based on the principle of
universality and in accordance with the established model
of parallel representation of divided countries at the United
Nations.” We trust that this item will soon secure a place
on the agenda of the General Assembly and that when it
does every Member State of this noble institution will give
its full support to this initiative. We cannot preach about the universality of the United Nations while at the same
time we ignore the aspirations of over 20 million people
in the Republic of China on Taiwan.","The Republic of China on Taiwan, which was once a
Member of this body, still finds itself on the outside,
knocking persistently at the doors of our chambers. It is the
view of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
which we also expressed at the last session, that the time
has come for serious consideration to be given to the
eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become
a Member of the United Nations. Our position is based on
the principle of universality and in accordance with the
established model of parallel representation of divided
countries. We have recognized the several parts of the
former Yugoslavia, and this model should continue to guide
our policy.
My delegation believes that the Republic of China on
Taiwan is fully equipped to play an expanded role in the
world economic arena. Its successful development
experience can indeed serve as a reference for developing
countries. Not only has the Republic of China on Taiwan
achieved economic success but, in a few years, its political
system has evolved from one characterized by authoritarian
rule into one based on democratic principles. We cannot
preach about the universality of the United Nations while
at the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 21 million
people. It is more than time for the Republic of China on Taiwan to be given the opportunity to make a tangible
contribution to the work of the United Nations.","I now turn my attention to the vexing question of the
resumed participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan
in the United Nations. This founding member of the
United Nations has been excluded from this body for a
quarter of a century. How does one reconcile this with the
principles of parallel representation of States and of
universality? It is time for the Republic of China on
Taiwan to be readmitted to this body. In our view, the
country not only possesses the attributes of nationhood,
but it is well endowed to contribute to the development of
Member States of this body. Its economic success is a
model for developing countries. The country has also
made democratic strides. I wish through this forum to
congratulate the Republic of China on Taiwan on the
holding of its first direct presidential election. It is really
a triumph of the democratic process. All States have not
embraced this process.","It is our hope that the issue regarding Taiwan can be
resolved peacefully. We urge those on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to hold discussions and negotiate a peaceful
solution in the reunification process to which both sides
are committed. We of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
are very grateful for the assistance we have received from
Taiwan, and we would hope that the international
community would respect its contribution to development
and that it may find its place in the international
community.","As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Year for Human Rights, we call on Member
States to remember the rights of the 21 million people in
Taiwan. The Republic of China on Taiwan, both
prosperous and democratic, deserves to be readmitted as
a member of the United Nations, even as it pursues the
goal of reunification. It is necessary that the United
Nations provide the forum for discussion that will provide
the framework for the peaceful reunification of both sides
of the Taiwan Strait.","A draft resolution on the readmission to this body of
the Republic of China on Taiwan was once again
defeated. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however,
strongly supports the aspiration of those 21 million people
to exercise their right to share and participate in the
activities of this community of nations.","We cannot preach about human rights and the
universality of the United Nations while at the same
time ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people
in the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of
the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that
the time has come when serious consideration should
be given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on
Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In
this regard, my Government is urging that the subject
be placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the
General Assembly. We urge every Member State of this
noble Organization to give its full support to this
worthy initiative for a country whose democratic
credentials cannot be challenged.","Following the admission of Tuvalu to the United
Nations last year, we were very close to realizing the
principle of universality set forth in the Charter of the
United Nations. Now, only one remaining country
awaits admission to the United Nations. That country,
as we all know, is the Republic of China on Taiwan.
The Republic of China’s impressive record of
economic and political development is one of the most
persuasive reasons to eliminate the United Nations sole
exception to universality. Fifty years ago, Taiwan was a
poor and underdeveloped society. Fifty years later, the
Republic of China on Taiwan has become an affluent and prosperous country, with a per capita gross national
product of around $14,000, annual trade of over $300
billion and a gross national product of $320 billion.
Although the Republic of China is only the one
hundred thirty-eighth largest country in the world in
terms of lands and the forty-sixth largest in terms of
population, it is today the world’s seventeenth largest
economy, the fifteenth largest trading nation, the eighth
largest investor, the fourth largest holder of foreign
exchange and the third largest exporter of information
technology products.
Under our principle of universality, we cannot
continue to exclude a country with such an impressive
record of achievements. The time has come to open our
doors to the Republic of China on Taiwan.","As we view the international scene, we are
troubled by the widespread and corrosive nature of
corruption in public life in many countries. The effects
in the developing countries are more debilitating. Corruption distorts the economies of those countries,
since, in effect, resources are taken from the poor and
given to the rich. My country, as part of its war against
corruption in public life, has recently ratified the
Organization of American States (OAS) Convention
against Corruption, which requires, among other
things, the criminalizing of illicit enrichment by public
officials and integrity legislation requiring a
declaration of assets by certain public officials. I
humbly suggest that the United Nations recognize the
pervasiveness of corruption in public life and its
consequent damages and take steps to approve and
promote a United Nations anti-corruption convention.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a very special
and beneficial relationship with the Republic of China
on Taiwan, which we value. It represents a test of
friendship, loyalty, reciprocity and shared values in our
relationship. The Republic of China on Taiwan, the
17th largest economy in the world, is a country of 23
million people that has made tremendous strides within
a few years to become one of the most economically
advanced countries in the Far East. It is a country that
practices and promotes human rights. It has a
Government that is democratically elected by the free
and unfettered expression of its citizens.
We strongly support Taiwan’s rights to be a
Member of this body of nations. We cannot understand
how the exclusion of Taiwan, which is a peace-loving,
responsible, democratic and progressive country, can
sit comfortably on the collective conscience of the
Member States of the United Nations. The United
Nations has a role to play in relations between Taiwan
and the People’s Republic of China. The United
Nations should play a facilitating role by providing a
forum for reconciliation and rapprochement between
the two sides. But — and I cannot stress this point too
strongly — the United Nations cannot play such a role
if it continues to exclude Taiwan. We shall continue to
support the legitimate aspirations of the 23 million
people of Taiwan, who remain voiceless in this
Assembly, to membership in this body and its agencies,
in accordance with the United Nations principle of
universality.","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cherishes the
relationships that it enjoys with all countries, both large
and small, represented here at the United Nations. The
United Nations Charter confers that freedom of
representation on all peace-loving and democratic States. Yet my country continues to be deeply troubled
that Taiwan is still being excluded from this body.
While we seek to make the United Nations more
efficient and effective through much-needed reform,
we can advance the cause and the call for reform by
making the United Nations more inclusive through the
admission to membership of Taiwan and its 23 million
people, who have no voice in the United Nations.
Taiwan is an exemplary global citizen that maintains
friendly relations with almost every country in the
world. We would wish for this Organization to be the
catalyst that promotes constructive dialogue and
friendly engagement so that the Taiwan situation can
be resolved in a peaceful, just and equitable way to the
benefit of the entire global family.","Since Saint Vincent and the Grenadines became
an independent State, it has had unbroken diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. We see
that country of liberty and democracy as a most
important component of the magnificent Chinese
civilization. Taiwan has the world’s seventeenth largest
economy and the fifteenth largest trading volume
internationally, and is third in the global ranking of the
extent of foreign exchange reserves held. Taiwan’s 23
million people ought properly to be represented in this
universal body by the Government of their choice. It is
a mistake to continue to deny Taiwan international
membership of organizations. The relations between
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Taiwan have
been exemplary. Our friendship demands that we plead
their just cause.","One of the best and most loyal friends over our
country’s 25 years of independence has been the
Republic of China on Taiwan. Our relationship has
been exemplary and is characterized by mutual respect,
solidarity and a desire for international peace, in
accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter
of the United Nations. Taiwan, a magnificent political
expression of the Chinese civilization, has partnered
beautifully with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a
component of our Caribbean civilization. We
unequivocally support the quest of Taiwan to be
represented at the United Nations and other
international bodies. It is unfair, unreasonable and
irrational to exclude a country of 23 million persons,
with a thriving economy and a nobility of purpose,
from the United Nations. Further, we urge the United
Nations to take the lead in promoting constructive
dialogue and friendly engagement between the
People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China
on Taiwan. Bellicose conduct across the Taiwan Strait
cannot be condoned in a world striving for enhanced
peace and collective security.","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines again pleads
with the United Nations to permit Taiwan, a democratic
and progressive country of 23 million people and a
legitimate political expression of the Chinese
civilization, to be accorded its rightful admission to the
United Nations and its specialized agencies. There is
no adequate justification for the continued exclusion of
Taiwan from participation in the numerous global
exchanges in the several international bodies, including
the United Nations. Further, the United Nations has a major role to
play in ensuring an easing of tensions across the
Taiwan straits. Aggressive conduct must be restrained
in a context in which Taiwan is committed to peace and
a comprehensive political dialogue. ","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines yet again pleads
with the United Nations to permit Taiwan to be
accorded its rightful admission to the United Nations
and its specialized agencies. Taiwan, a democratic and
progressive country of 23 million people, remains a
legitimate and vibrant political expression of the
ancient and magnificent Chinese civilization. There is
no adequate justification for the continued exclusion of
Taiwan from participation in the numerous global
exchanges in the United Nations and other
international bodies. We urge Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon to accept and deal with Taiwan’s membership
application in accordance with the Charter. Taiwan
possesses all the attributes and qualifications for
membership of the United Nations. Let it therefore be
done. Furthermore, the United Nations must play its
role in reducing tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Aggressive conduct must be restrained in a context
where Taiwan is committed to peace and a
comprehensive political dialogue. ","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines once again
pleads with the international community to be
cognizant of the plight of Taiwan’s 23 million people.
Even though the United Nations historical neglect of
the Taiwan issue has not been a source of pride, the
Government of Taiwan has acted responsibly and
without confrontation to subordinate many of its
legitimate political claims into efforts aimed at
reducing cross-Strait tensions, promoting peace and
building relations with the People’s Republic of China.
 The United Nations must now act to ensure the
survival of that fledgling rapprochement. Taiwan
should be encouraged on its path to peace by
permitting its meaningful participation in the
specialized agencies of the United Nations. Much as
Taiwan’s vibrant economy is recognized through its
participation in WTO, there is no compelling reason
why its equally vibrant people should be denied
participation in the World Health Organization and
other specialized agencies. ","The theme of exclusion is equally applicable to
our friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its
specialized agencies must find ways to ensure the
meaningful participation of the 23 million people of
Taiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited
inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global
health challenges have logically compelled their
participation in the World Health Assembly, so too
should the global reach of climate change merit their meaningful participation in the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
 The interconnected networks of global air travel
and our shared safety concerns similarly mandate the
participation of Taiwan in the International Civil
Aviation Organization. The Government and people of
Taiwan have advanced a reasonable and responsible
policy of engagement to usher a new era in cross-strait
relations. The international community can and should
encourage and reward this fledgling rapprochement
with meaningful participation in the relevant
specialized agencies. ","In that regard, we once again highlight the case of
our friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its
specialized agencies must find ways to ensure the
meaningful participation of the 23 million people of
Taiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited
inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global
health challenges have logically compelled their
participation in the World Health Assembly, so too
should the global reach of climate change merit the
meaningful participation of Taiwan in the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The interconnectedness of global air travel, and our
shared safety concerns, similarly mandate the participation of Taiwan in the International Civil
Aviation Authority. This is not the case of a tiny
non-governmental organization, to be allowed or
denied meaningful participation on some bureaucratic
whim. This is a legitimate and vibrant expression of
the ancient and noble Chinese culture, with a
population 200 times greater than that of Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines.
 The Government and people of Taiwan have
advanced a reasonable and responsible policy of
engagement to usher in a new era in cross-Strait
relations, and have an enviable record of development
cooperation and assistance around the world. The
international community can and should encourage and
reward this responsible global citizenship with
meaningful participation in the relevant specialized
agencies. ","As I reflect on the sweeping geopolitical changes
being wrought in our global village, I am compelled to
raise the fact that there is no practical, legal or logical
justification for the seeming indifference of the United
Nations to the meaningful participation of Taiwan in
our important work. Surely, in the context of an everexpanding and inclusive United Nations, the 23 million
citizens of Taiwan can, at the very least, be allowed to
meaningfully participate in the specialized agencies of
the Organization — and that should extend beyond the
World Trade Organization and the World Health
Assembly. ","The fascinating rapprochement unfolding across the
Taiwan straits between the People’s Republic of China
and the Republic of China on Taiwan lends practical weight to the reasonable and overdue call for Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in the specialized agencies
of the United Nations. My country and several others
in the Caribbean and Central America bear witness to
Taiwan’s principled conduct of its intergovernmental
relations. Surely the time has now come for this
exemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be
permitted to participate in the work of various agencies
of this world body.","At the same time, I applaud the efforts of those
developed nations that take their ODA commitments
seriously. I hail, too, a raft of other countries that are
in a genuine developmental and functional partnership
with us. These include Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba,
Venezuela and Taiwan. Indeed, Taiwan, a country not
washed by our Caribbean Sea, has been remarkable in its
principled and practical conduct of intergovernmental relations. Surely the time has now come for this
exemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be
permitted to participate fully in the work of the various
agencies of this world body.","The prestige and legitimacy of the United Nations
can be further enhanced through further acceptance
of the reasonable calls for Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the specialized agencies of the United
Nations. Taiwan already participates actively and
constructively in many critical international bodies.
My country and several others in the Caribbean and
Central America bear testimony to Taiwan’s principled
conduct of its intergovernmental relations. Surely the time has now come for this exemplar of the magnificent
Chinese civilization to be permitted to participate in
the work of various agencies of this world body.","This seventieth year of the United Nations must
therefore be a year of not only action but also inclusion,
outreach and redress of calcified injustices. As such,
we must move beyond our inexplicable exclusion of
Taiwan from the work of the specialized agencies of
the United Nations. The perspective, experience and
example of Taiwan as an active and responsible global
citizen are self-evident arguments in support of their
greater inclusion and participation. Taiwan’s continued
exclusion can be neither explained nor justified by any
rational and forward-looking global gathering.","This year marks the inauguration of a new,
democratically elected President of the Republic of
China on Taiwan. The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reaffirms our continued solidarity
with the aspirations of the Taiwanese Government and
people, just as they have stood with us throughout our
post-independence development journey. We decry the
myopia of a body that pretends 24 million people do
not exist and that has forced people to choose between
two magnificent exemplars of the noble Chinese
civilization. Such behaviour marginalizes a vibrant
population and creates space for parasitic opportunists
to prostitute principle for personal gain. We must
recognize Taiwan’s exemplary global leadership
and citizenship and its commitment to development
worldwide. It is high time that the Republic of China on
Taiwan be allowed to participate meaningfully in all of
the specialized bodies and programmes of the United
Nations system. There is absolutely no compelling
argument to the contrary.","In the quest for deepening multilateralism,
international cooperation and peace, the glaring injustice
of the continuing denial of Taiwan’s membership in
the special agencies of the United Nations demands
correction. The ghosts of a divisive past ought to be
laid to rest. Taiwan’s legitimate incorporation into the
family of nations is long overdue. How can we neglect
or deny 23 billion people who have been contributing
so much to developing countries in every sector of their
economy? How can we deny them entrance into the
organs of the United Nations? It is unfair and unjust
and should be remedied.","Our pragmatism affords us the opportunity to
see the world as it is, unencumbered by historical or
ideological blinders. The United Nations, which justly
counts States with populations as small as 10,000 people
among its Members, somehow continues to remain
blind to the 23 million residents of Taiwan. There is
simply no principled basis to deny Taiwan the right to
participate in the work of the specialized agencies of
the United Nations.","International cooperation is essential to addressing
these vexing challenges of modern globalization
and sustainable development. Some of our allies,
such as Taiwan, have been exemplary in offering
their perspectives and support to our development
aspirations, and have proved time and again that
they are more than deserving of a meaningful role
in the specialized agencies and bodies of the United
Nations. Indeed, South-South cooperation is moving
increasingly from the periphery to centre stage of the
global political economy, to the benefit of SIDS such as
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian
people whose daily existence remain marred by the persistent threat of illegal
annexation. Honouring the Palestinian peoples’ long held quest for self-determination
and statehood by revisiting the question of full membership at the United Nations is
a matter that is long overdue, and an essential component of a lasting Two-State
Solution in the quest for a sustainable peace in the Middle East. In a similar vein,
the constructive and pragmatic intergovernmental engagement of Taiwan, as a
responsible advocate for sustainable development and an exemplar of the magnificent
Chinese Civilization, validates the case for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the
specialised agencies and bodies of the United Nations."
Swaziland,,,,"At the beginning of my address I expressed the Swazi
delegation’s welcome for the accession of six new Members
as an indication of the Organization’s respect for the
principle of universality. We confirmed that it is a basic
human right of all peoples to be represented at the United
Nations so that the widest possible range of opinions and
experience may be pooled, and the benefits of the
Organization shared by all countries. Yet the Kingdom of Swaziland has enjoyed a long and
happy relationship with 21 million people who believe that
they have had no representation here since 1971: I refer to
the people of the Republic of China.
For the past 25 years the Republic of China has shown
itself to be a true friend of Swaziland. We have benefited
from the experience of development which has lifted the
Republic of China to a position high on the list of
industrialized nations. The rest of the world has been
excluded from that experience and from the positive
contribution that we feel the Republic of China can make to
the international community. It is a contribution that the
Government and the people of that nation have demonstrated
their will and desire to make. And 21 million people feel
that they are denied the right of representation here in the
United Nations by men and women of their own choice. In
the interest of equity and justice, their collective voice
deserves to be heard.
Swaziland therefore supports the call from other
Member States for the establishment of an ad hoc committee
to look into the issue of the Republic of China’s re-entry
into the United Nations.","I spoke earlier of South Africa’s return to the
international community, as, among other things, a triumph
for the United Nations in upholding the principle of
universality. The Kingdom of Swaziland urges the
Assembly to apply the same principle to investigate the
merits of the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan. His Majesty King Mswati III joined a number of other
Heads of State in raising this issue at the forty-eighth
session of the General Assembly. His Majesty called for
the establishment of an ad hoc committee to determine
whether or not the Republic of China had a reasonable case
for rejoining our Organization. This call has been taken up
by an increasing number of countries that support the idea
of looking into the issue in more detail.
Quite apart from the principle of universality, there are
other important factors for us to consider when reviewing
the case. The Republic of China in Taiwan has much to
offer to the world community. It clearly has the resources
to be of more use to the rest of the international
community. More important, though, is the desire of the
Republic of China to be of use - and assistance - to the rest
of the world.
The Kingdom of Swaziland, along with a large
number of other developing countries throughout Africa,
Asia and the Americas, has had first-hand evidence of the
Republic of China’s willingness to offer generous
humanitarian and development assistance.
As more and more worthy targets appear for the
United Nations resources, we can surely ill afford to reject
the call to investigate further whether that country’s
assistance can be put to wider use through the agencies of
our Organization.
At the heart of the issue, though, is the fact that 21
million people believe that they are not represented in the
United Nations. These people believe that they are
excluded from our founding principle of universality. In
consideration of this right, which they believe has been
denied them, the time has surely come for us to listen to
their voices.
The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes and supports the
participation of the Republic of China In Taiwan in the
activities of the United Nations, and we therefore call once
more for the establishment of an ad hoc committee to
review the case for their re-admittance to the Organization.","The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to have a
strong and happy partnership with a country whose people
believe that they are denied the opportunity to make their
contribution to the rest of the world through the agencies
of our Organization, and who maintain that they are
excluded from the processes of international
decision-making, to which they have a right to contribute.
The Republic of China and its 21 million people have
shown themselves to be committed to global peace and
development, and ready to share with the rest of the
world their knowledge, expertise and resources.
In the fiftieth year of the existence of United
Nations, and as we celebrate the historic signing of our
Charter, it is surely fitting that we live up to our
founders’ belief that the credibility of our Organization is
dependent on the principle that all mankind is represented
here. The declaration by a people that it believes itself to
be denied representation is surely incentive enough for us
to at least consider the case, whatever the outcome. The
Republic of China, as one of the original signatories,
believes that its appeal deserves to be heard. Swaziland
therefore encourages the growing support for the
establishment of an ad hoc committee to look into the
issue of the renewal of membership of the United Nations
for the Republic of China.",,"For almost 30 years the Kingdom of Swaziland has
enjoyed excellent relations with a nation which, despite an
outstanding record in international development
assistance, and while fulfilling all the requirements for
membership of our Organization, is nonetheless excluded
from participating in the activities of the United Nations.
I am referring to the issue of the Government of the
Republic of China on Taiwan.
In October 1971 the United Nations adopted a
resolution which withdrew membership from the Republic
of China. That resolution has the effect today of denying
the rights of almost 22 million people to be represented
here in the United Nations, and to contribute to all the
global initiatives undertaken by our Organization.
The Kingdom of Swaziland has been in a position to
recognize and experience at first hand the peace-loving
nature of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its willingness to help foster peace and prosperity throughout
the world. The Government and people of the Republic of
China have made enormous advances in economic, social
and political terms, and have shown themselves ready and
able to share their experience and advice with all the
nations of the world.
Many countries and political groupings over the years
have also recognized the need to involve the Republic of
China on Taiwan in global development activities, through
the offices of the United Nations and its agencies. There is
also a growing voice of international opinion, including in
the European Parliament, the American Congress and
among many countries on all five continents, that
membership of the United Nations is necessary for the huge
resources and wealth of expertise of the Republic of China
to be put to the best possible use for the benefit of all
mankind.
One of the founding and guiding principles of our
Organization has been that of universality, of granting all
peoples of the world the right to belong to the United
Nations and to be heard in our chambers. It is a reality that
almost 22 million people believe that that right is denied to
them, by virtue of their country's exclusion from the
activities of the one truly global development Organization.
The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore proposes to its fellow
Member States that the time has now come to review the
resolution of 26 years ago. We believe that there is an
urgent need to re-examine this issue, taking into account the
profound changes in the situation that have occurred since
1971.","It is unfortunate to note that, even as we celebrate 50
years of existence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is one nation of 21.8 million people that we
believe is denied the right of membership of the United
Nations. I am referring to the question of the Republic of
China on Taiwan.
The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to raise this
issue because of our conviction that the United Nations
Charter provides for the representation of all nations of the
world. Furthermore, the Republic of China on Taiwan has
shown very clearly that it is a nation with the willingness
and capacity to play a prominent and responsible role in
global development affairs, and yet it remains excluded
from the activities of the one truly global development
organization.
The principle of universality, as contained in our
founding Charter, provides that all citizens of the world
have the right to be heard in these chambers, and yet it is
a fact that as I speak the people of the Republic of China
on Taiwan are not represented here and therefore cannot
contribute their resources and expertise for the benefit of
the international community through the medium of the
United Nations.
The Republic of China on Taiwan has shown itself to
be a peace-loving nation, with a high level of political,
economic and social development. It has an excellent record
of supporting development activities throughout the world.
The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the time has now
come to restore its rightful membership of the United
Nations to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We join the
rest of our fellow members in proposing a review of this
issue, with full regard for the change in circumstances since
the decision was taken in 1971 which led to the expulsion
of the Republic of China on Taiwan from our Organization.","But even as we welcome these new Members, the
Kingdom of Swaziland is conscious that the principle of
universality is not applied equally to others who feel
excluded from the activities of our Organization. I refer
to the 22 million people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan, who believe that they are being denied their right to representation in the United Nations. The Government
and the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have
shown their willingness and capacity to contribute actively
to global development and peace, through disaster relief and
development support to many countries and regions. The
Republic of China on Taiwan is clearly a peace-loving
nation, and is highly developed in all economic, social and
political spheres. It is the view of the Kingdom of Swaziland that
international peace and security and equitable development
for all mankind, can be achieved only through the inclusion
of all the people of the world in the one truly global
development Organization. We therefore support the call
from an increasing number of Member States for the
establishment of a working group by the General Assembly
to examine the exceptional international situation relating to
the Republic of China on Taiwan and to ensure that the
fundamental right of its 22 million people to participate in
the work and activities of the United Nations is fully
respected. We recognize that, as has been the case in some
other nations, the matter of reunification is for the Chinese
people themselves.","In the same spirit of universality in which we
welcome Tuvalu, the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to
reiterate its appeal to the United Nations regarding the
question of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The
Kingdom of Swaziland has in the past been in the
forefront arguing in favour of the readmission of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, and our position remains
unchanged. The case for including the Republic of
China on Taiwan in the activities of the United Nations
and its associated agencies takes on even greater
relevance in the light of the peaceful transition of
Government following the successful expression of the
wishes of the people of Taiwan in the elections earlier
this year.
Those 23 million people rightly consider it
unacceptable that they are not represented in the one
Organization that should be truly global, and that they
deserve a review of the special circumstances
surrounding their bid. The Republic of China on
Taiwan has shown time and again its willingness to
participate in efforts to bring about true global peace,
development and stability, and we believe that the rest
of the world is poorer for being denied their
involvement. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that
this new millennium provides the perfect opportunity
to raise this issue and to restore the right of the people
of the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate fully
in the activities of our Organization.
There is no alternative to the United Nations. Its
objectives and values are universal. We must spare no
effort in seeing to it that the United Nations continues
to meet the current and evolving needs of its entire
membership. It must become the core instrument of
effective and fair global governance, if it is to be
completely transformed to be what its founding fathers
had envisaged.","Acknowledging the importance of this principle,
the Kingdom of Swaziland raises once more the
question of the inclusion of the Republic of China on
Taiwan in the activities of the United Nations and its associated agencies. We appeal on behalf of the 23
million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan for
their right to representation in the United Nations
Organization. The Government and people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan have shown themselves
to be wholly committed to observing the principles and
spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and of the Charter of the United Nations.
In addition to the peaceful democratic transition
that took place last year, the recent admission of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization attests to the significant contribution the
Republic of China has made and will continue to make
to international trade. The Republic of China on
Taiwan has shown time and again its willingness to
participate in efforts to bring about true global peace,
development and security, and its commitment to
utilize its resources for the benefit of mankind.
The Kingdom of Swaziland has been at the
forefront of efforts to support the readmittance of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations.
Our position on this important issue remains
unchanged. We therefore appeal to our fellow Members
to support the establishment of a working group to
examine in detail the exceptional international situation
relating to the Republic of China on Taiwan, with a view to ensuring that its 23 million people can
contribute actively to the international community
through participation in the United Nations and its
related agencies.","The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to extend
a warm welcome to the United Nations newest
Member, Switzerland, and soon-to-be Member East
Timor. There now remains just one group of people
that is denied the opportunity to participate in the
activities of the United Nations and its associated
agencies. I refer here to the 23 million inhabitants of
the Republic of China on Taiwan, a sovereign State and
a constructive member of the international community.
These 23 million people have shown time and
again that they are willing and able to contribute to the
international community. At this critical time in the
history of the world, which is faced with the challenges
of instability, under-development and economic
difficulties, we cannot afford to exclude from our joint
efforts the resources and skills of the Republic of
China on Taiwan. As a democratic, prosperous and
peace-loving nation, Taiwan has displayed her
readiness to assist the development challenges of her
friends and partners, and has intervened in
humanitarian crises across the globe. Taiwan needs the
United Nations, and the United Nations needs Taiwan.
We therefore appeal once more to our fellow Members
to recognize the right of the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to representation in the
United Nations system, and to take the appropriate
measures to achieve this objective. ","Another important issue facing this body is the
continued exclusion of the Republic of China on
Taiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands
Government reiterates its concern that the exclusion of
a nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not
consistent with the inclusive ideal of the United
Nations. I therefore strongly urge every Member State
to reconsider this matter. as envisaged by our founding fathers and as enshrined
in the principle of universality. Acknowledging the
importance of this principle, the Kingdom of Swaziland
raises the issue of the inclusion once more of the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the
United Nations and its associated agencies. Our
principled position on this important issue remains
unchanged.
The Republic of China on Taiwan has shown time
and again its willingness to participate in efforts to
bring about true global peace, development and
security, as well as its commitment to utilize resources
for the benefit of mankind. We therefore fail to understand why the people of Taiwan cannot be part of
this great family of nations.","For more than 30 years, the Kingdom of
Swaziland has been enjoying excellent relations with a
nation which, despite an outstanding record in
international development assistance and despite
fulfilling every requirement for membership in the
Organization, is nonetheless excluded from
participation in the activities of the United Nations. I
am referring here to the issue of the 23 million people
of the Republic of China on Taiwan, who are denied
the right to contribute to the global initiatives
undertaken by this world body. The Government and
the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have
made enormous advances in economic, social and
political terms, and they have shown themselves ready
and able to share their experience and advice with all
the nations of the world. The Kingdom of Swaziland,
therefore, proposes to the Assembly that the time has
come to revisit this issue so as to ensure the inclusion
of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of
the United Nations and its associated agencies.","As we discuss greater representation and wider
participation in the United Nations system, and as we
celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization,
allow me to remind all of us gathered here that the
more than 23 million people of the Republic of China
remain hopeful that their voice in quest of participation
in the very important United Nations system will soon
be heard and positively responded to, so that they too
can make their valuable contributions to the
management and prosperity of world affairs. In the
meantime, it is our continued hope that the existing
issues between the parties will be resolved peacefully.","However, as we welcome our new Member, we
remain conscious of the fact that the principle of
universality has not been applied to its fullest. I am
referring to the exclusion of Taiwan. With the
admission of Montenegro, almost all the countries of
the world have become Members of this global
Organization, all except one — Taiwan. The exclusion
of this nation poses a legal and a moral challenge to the
international community. The time has come for the
United Nations to stop enforcing a policy of exclusion
against the 23.6 million people of Taiwan. The
Kingdom of Swaziland believes that accepting Taiwan
as a member of the United Nations would not only
restore the rights of the people of that island but would
also contribute to ensuring that peace and stability is
maintained in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that every
country in that region should be allowed to participate
in working towards peace, stability and positive
development. We propose, therefore, that General
Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 be
reviewed carefully, with a view to restoring the legal
and moral rights of the people of Taiwan to be part of
the United Nations family. ","I would like to take this time to applaud the
United Nations for its role in promoting its Charter,
especially the principle of universality. There is one
country, however, that is not benefiting from this
principle, as it has been excluded from the family of
nations.
 I am talking about Taiwan: the Kingdom of
Swaziland wishes to reiterate its appeal to the United
Nations with respect to the question of Taiwan. We
note that Taiwan exercised a well-founded right in
international law to apply for membership in the
United Nations. Regrettably, the application was
rejected without due process.
 The Government and people of Taiwan have
shown their willingness and capacity to contribute
actively to global development and peace, through
disaster relief and health and development support to many regions. We continue to support the cause of the
over 23 million people of Taiwan who are not
represented in the one organization that should be truly
global. I would like to challenge all nations to take my
appeal seriously. ","We welcome the recent handshake between the
senior leadership of the Republic of China on Taiwan
and that of mainland China. This handshake gives us
hope that the two are now talking to each other.
Hopefully, this might lead to an amicable resolution of
the cross-Strait relations, such that perhaps one day we
might see them sitting next to each other here at the
United Nations. It should be noted that the people of
Taiwan have expertise and experience, which they are
ready to share with the United Nations family. That is
why Swaziland requests the United Nations to allow
Taiwan to participate in its specialized agencies. ","We are happy to acknowledge the improvements
in the relations between the Republic of China on
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That new
development has resulted in the international
community responding positively to the request of
Taiwan to be involved in United Nations agencies, as
evidenced by the granting of observer status in the
World Health Assembly. We look forward to seeing
Taiwan being allowed to fully contribute to humanity
by being given adequate participation in other United
Nations specialized agencies. ","Developments in cross-straits relations between
the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China continue to be a source of
inspiration to us all. We note with appreciation that the
Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s
Republic of China have made impressive strides to
promote mutual understanding leading to more trade
and interaction between them. I am happy to say that
Taiwan highly appreciates being allowed to participate
as an observer in the World Health Organization. Hopefully, this will also lead to Taiwan’s participating
in a similar manner in all other United Nations
agencies. Of particular interest is the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. ","In today’s highly integrated and interconnected
world, almost all issues demand the full participation
of international partners. Taiwan is one of the leading
economic and technological powerhouses of the world
today, and the Kingdom of Swaziland is of the view
that Taiwan can contribute successfully to the international community. We therefore urge the United
Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in its specialized agencies and
mechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. There is no doubt that
the there is a functional need to include the people of
Taiwan in the United Nations system and that their
inclusion would be in the common interest of the
international community.  ","We must commend the recent positive developments
with regard to relations between the Republic of
China on Taiwan and mainland China, which are
steadily improving. Indeed, it is very encouraging
as it demonstrates that the tensions between the two
countries have subsided. We hope that one day they
will be able to resolve all of their differences and live
happily with each other. We are witnessing increasing
trade, as well as flights, between the two countries.
Recently, it was also interesting to see mainland China
host an African summit, to which the countries that are
friends of Taiwan were also invited.
As an African country, we would like to thank
mainland China for its continued support to African
countries. We have no doubt that the potential of the
two peoples working together side by side will make
a significant difference in the world. We hope that the
new developments will pave the way for Taiwan to
participate fully in all United Nations entities, because
the people of Taiwan desire to become part of the global
community.","The Kingdom of eSwatini is happy to note that,
with solid international support and cross-Strait
developments, the Republic of China on Taiwan has
increased its meaningful participation in United
Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We
will continue to encourage positive interaction in the
international arena between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait. ","The Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini is
pleased to note that the Republic of China on Taiwan
continues to contribute to global issues, and the
positive developments taking place in that region are
encouraging. We encourage their full participation in
all United Nations structures.","We trust that, as we proceed with the 2030 Agenda,
we will fully embrace an all-inclusive approach.
We therefore urge the United Nations to give every
country in the world the opportunity to contribute to
the global community in whatever form and capacity
it can. In that regard, we appeal to the United Nations
to consider admitting the Republic of China on Taiwan
to membership. Like every other country, it has the potential to contribute positively to the global agenda,
in its case in such areas as health care and information
and communications technology, to mention only a few.
The inclusiveness espoused by the United Nations
should encompass representation in the key bodies of
the Organization. The African continent continues to
appeal for a permanent seat on the Security Council
through which its voice will be fully represented, as
outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus. We trust that the
matter will receive the attention it deserves.","According to the Charter of the United Nations,
the Organization’s mission is to reaffirm faith in
fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person and in the equal rights of men and
women and of nations large and small. Accordingly, the
23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan
should enjoy the same fundamental rights as any other
people. Taiwan is mostly unable to attend the meetings
and activities of United Nations specialized agencies.
Thus the welfare of its people and, by extension, all
humankind, is adversely affected. There is no doubt
that their membership will add value to the family’s
universal push to transform our world.","Among the political issues that have continued
unresolved for too long is the denial of the right of
the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to
participate in the United Nations system. Taiwan has
shown significant commitment to the ideals of the
United Nations and has aligned its priorities with those
of the Organization. Humankind could therefore benefit
a great deal from Taiwan’s experience in the framework
of our global agenda as Member of the United Nations.","The Kingdom of Eswatini reiterates its unwavering
stance as it calls on the United Nations to afford
the people of the Republic of China, Taiwan, the
opportunity to contribute to and partake in the United
Nations development system. Taiwan’s experience in
fields that are vital to various dimensions of sustainable
development would go a long way towards contributing
to the work and well-being of the membership of the United Nations. We wish to make a strong appeal for
the people of Taiwan not to be left behind, with a view
to keeping the United Nations relevant to all people, in
line with the spirit of universality.","The United Nations bid to leave no one behind will
remain elusive if we continue to deprive other nations
of the world the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the
affairs of this universal Assembly. We firmly believe
that Taiwan is essential to the full implementation
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Its inclusion is a crucial step in realizing the pledge
stipulated in the preamble to resolution 70/1, adopted
on 25 September 2015. We once again call on the United
Nations to uphold the principle of universality, continue
its multilateral efforts towards total inclusion and allow
Taiwan to participate in relevant efforts on a dignified
and equal footing.","As we conclude, among the political issues that have continued to fester for
too long is the continued denial of the right of the People of Taiwan to participate in
the UN system.
Taiwan has shown significant commitment to the ideals of the United Nations
and has aligned her priorities with those of the organization. Taiwan has, further,
committed significant resources to the attainment of the Sustainable Development
Goals, not only within her own boundaries, but going so far as to assist other
Countries to do the same."
Tonga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tonga adheres strictly to the “one China” policy
and recognizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China. We welcome the shared principle of noninterference in each other’s internal affairs and, as
such, we consider that delicate and sensitive issues are
best dealt with in an across-the-Strait dialogue rather
than at international forums.","The Kingdom continues to observe a “one-China”
policy that recognizes Taiwan as an integral and
inalienable part of China. An essential component of
that policy properly acknowledges that common and
mutual issues are ideally left to an across-the-Strait
framework dialogue, as opposed to any multilateral
formula, however well conceived.",,"On the question of Taiwan, Tonga is of the view
that maintaining the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Member States and non-interference in the
internal affairs of Member States are among the
cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations. Thus, Tonga continues to adhere to the
one-China policy, recognizing Taiwan as an integral
part of China. ","This year marks the tenth anniversary of the
normalization of relations between Nuku’alofa and
Beijing. This milestone has reaffirmed Tonga’s
commitment to the observance of the One China
policy, with the state of relations and economic
cooperation between our two countries continuing to
flourish and prosper. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Tuvalu,,,,,,,,,,,,"Universal cooperation against threats to peace
and stability cannot, however, be fully achieved as long
as the United Nations lacks the will to recognize fair
and just representation within it of a democratic and
economically developed State with a population of 23
million. The Republic of China on Taiwan is also
suffering in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist
attacks, having lost innocent lives as well as property.
Like us, they suffer from the onslaught of natural
disasters; epidemics and diseases, including the HIV/
AIDS pandemic; and other threats of instability. Yet in all these crises, and despite their enormous
contribution to the world economy and international
development — including technological
advancement — as well as their consistent
demonstration of international responsibility, the
people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have been
left to fend for themselves, denied the right to proper
representation and collaboration, not only in the United
Nations and its specialized agencies, such as the World
Health Organization, but in nearly every other
intergovernmental body. The voice with which they
could share their plight and thereby benefit from world
cooperation is silenced. However, the irony is that for
more than 50 years, no authority other than the
Republic of China on Taiwan itself has had full
sovereign control over Taiwan, its population and the
running of its affairs. To visit the country, for example,
one must have immigration papers issued by its own
authorities.
While we welcome the wise decision of the
World Trade Organization last week to admit the
Republic of China on Taiwan, it is Tuvalu’s strong
view that the United Nations must take the lead and
seriously reconsider United Nations membership for
the Republic of China on Taiwan, beyond the politics
of exclusion and on the basis of the reality of things.","As a peace-loving nation, Tuvalu believes that the
paramount mission of the United Nations must remain
the maintenance of peace and security for all nations of
the world, as clearly articulated in the preamble to the
United Nations Charter. However, a long outstanding
issue that also warrants serious consideration is the
question of the Republic of China on Taiwan. This
country has a population of 23 million people, a welldefined territory and an established democratic system
of Government, and is a responsible international actor
in world trade and relations. It is, therefore, our strong
opinion that the right to self-determination of the
people of the Republic of China and to join the United
Nations should be urgently addressed. The United
Nations cannot be said to be universal, nor can global
peace be assured, until the Republic of China issue is
properly resolved.","In the same spirit, Tuvalu places significant
importance on the need to treat everybody equally, as
enshrined in the Charter. Accordingly, Tuvalu believes
that to deny representation at the United Nations to the
23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan,
who are active and responsible participants in world
affairs, especially in trade, commerce and international
development, is unjust and morally wrong. Their
significant contributions to technology and their own
need for access to international support to combat the
challenges of terrorism and health epidemics such as
HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) cannot be continually ignored.
In our view the United Nations, which prides
itself on the protection of fundamental human rights,
including the right to self-determination, and which
upholds the dignity and worth of the human being,
cannot continue to turn a blind eye to ignore the
obvious realities of the situation. Just as the people of
Taiwan have so responsibly contributed to international
development, they also need the support of the
international community. Their continuing isolation
could potentially give rise to serious conflicts.
Tuvalu would therefore like to call on this august
body to seriously and urgently consider the issue of
membership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
United Nations and its agencies.","An issue of continuing concern to Tuvalu is the
question of the representation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations. Regrettably, this
Organization cannot be said to be universal without the
rightful representation of the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan. Tuvalu feels that the
active and responsible participation of the Republic of
China on Taiwan in world affairs — especially in trade,
commerce and international development — without
representation in the United Nations is unjust and
morally wrong and needs to be corrected.","An issue of continuing concerns to Tuvalu is the
question of the representation in the United Nations.
Regrettably, this august body cannot be said to be
universal without the rightful representation of the 23
million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.
Tuvalu feels that recognizing the political and
democratic developments in Taiwan, the active and
responsible participation of Taiwan in world affairs,
especially in trade, commerce, health, and international
development, without representation in the United
Nations is unjust and morally wrong. This state of
affairs needs to be corrected. We seek a proper review
by the United Nations of this important issue, as well
as the escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait following the enactment by the People’s Republic of
China of its “anti-secession law”.","Clearly the United Nations has done well in
preventing and resolving deadly conflicts throughout
the world. But despite those achievements, the nonrepresentation of Taiwan in the United Nations and its
agencies remains an issue of great concern. The threats
posed by China’s deployment of missiles aimed at
Taiwan and the use of force in the Taiwan Strait are
real, for the East Asian and Pacific region and for the
world as a whole. We urge that immediate peaceful and
preventive actions be taken in the Taiwan Strait for the
sake of all. ","However, the United Nations cannot be said to be
universal nor can global peace and security be assured
until the issue of Taiwan’s membership and
participation in the United Nations is properly
resolved. It is disappointing to note that this body does
not even want to at least put Taiwan’s membership
application on its agenda for proper consideration.
 Let me reaffirm Tuvalu’s strong support for
Taiwan’s membership application to the United
Nations. We feel that this issue is long overdue and
needs to be considered more seriously and purely on its
own merits.
 Taiwan has shown international responsibility
and has helped many countries in the world —
including my own country, Tuvalu — with
development assistance. It is our strong opinion that
Taiwan is a country with a clearly defined territory and
an established democratic system of government and is
a responsible international player in world trade,
development and diplomatic relations. The rights and
self-determination of the Taiwanese people to join the
United Nations should be urgently addressed. Taiwan has all of the capabilities needed to fulfil its
obligations as a peace-loving State and become a full
Member of the United Nations as required under the
Charter of the United Nations. Despite all this, it is sad to note that the United
Nations has continued to turn a blind eye to the wishes
and needs of the people of Taiwan, who simply want to
be part of the international family and participate
actively in the attainment of the noble pillars of
development, security and human rights. More sadly,
the action taken by the Secretary-General of the United
Nations in not complying with the requirements of the
Charter of the United Nations and the rules of
procedure of the Security Council is disappointing.
Tuvalu further appeals for the proper and urgent
consideration of Taiwan’s membership application to
the United Nations. ","Tuvalu believes strongly that nations have the
right to self-determination. The United Nations must
uphold this principle. Therefore, we believe it is time
that the United Nations properly addressed the issue of
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United
Nations specialized agencies. My Government strongly
supports Taiwan’s aspirations to meaningfully
participate in the United Nations and its specialized
agencies, recognizing Taiwan’s own political and
economic achievements and its constructive
contribution to international development, trade,
health, education and technology. We appeal strongly
that Taiwan’s aspirations to participate as a full member of specialized agencies of the United Nations
be given proper and urgent attention. ","I am compelled again to draw the attention of
United Nations Member States to the plight of the
people and Government of Taiwan. As a proud nation
of 23 million people, Taiwan must be given the right to
self-determination — a principle that must be upheld
by the United Nations. Taiwan also has all of the
hallmarks of nationhood. It has a democratic system of
Government and it is certainly a responsible
international player in world trade, development and
diplomatic relations; not least, Taiwan has a clearly
defined territory.
 Although Tuvalu appreciates the long-overdue
courtesy finally accorded to the Government of Taiwan
to participate as an observer to the World Health
Organization’s (WHO) World Health Assembly this
year, Tuvalu strongly believes that Taiwan deserves to
participate more fully as a member of WHO and other
United Nations specialized agencies. Tuvalu therefore
reiterates its strong appeal for Taiwan’s aspirations and
desire to participate meaningfully as a full member of
the specialized agencies of the United Nations to be
given the proper and urgent attention they deserve.
 In conclusion, my Government acknowledges
with full confidence that globalization and its impact in
every corner of the globe cannot be denied. This makes
the role of the United Nations even more important.
However, we need to conclude the long-overdue
reforms of the United Nations, especially the Security
Council and the General Assembly, to enable the
Organization to deliver its services in a more
transparent, coherent, efficient and effective manner. ","While we applaud and strongly support the
continuing significant role played by the United
Nations as the major peacekeeping body in the
international community, the efforts and progress made
by Taiwan in pursuing peace on both sides of the
Straits needs special recognition and encouragement by
the United Nations. In addition, we strongly believe
that with its active involvement and contributions to
international trade, investment, air transport, finance, telecommunications technology and environmental
protection, Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as
a member of the World Health Organization and other
United Nations specialized agencies such as the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. Tuvalu therefore urges the United Nations
specialized agencies to accommodate Taiwan’s
meaningful participation in their respective systems
and activities. ","Our collective efforts to strengthen and maintain
peace across the globe will be meaningless, if the
United Nations continues to turn blind eyes and deaf
ears to Taiwan’s contribution and efforts toward those
common goals. Furthermore, Taiwan’s continued
contribution to the international community as one of
the committed development partners cannot be
overemphasized. In that regard, Tuvalu strongly urges
the United Nations to recognize those contributions
without any reservations. In particular, Tuvalu calls
upon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially
the World Health Organization and the International
Civil Aviation Organization, to allow Taiwan to
participate fully and meaningfully in their meetings
and activities, including in United Nations meetings on
climate change. ","Our collective and global efforts to have peace
and security as a prerequisite for the stability needed
for global economic growth, sustainable development
and social progress will be meaningless if the United
Nations continues not to recognize and acknowledge
Taiwan’s significant contribution and efforts towards
the East China Sea peace initiative for regional
stability and peace. Furthermore, Taiwan’s continued
contribution to the international community as one of
the committed development partners and responsible
stakeholders in achieving the Millennium Development
Goals should be recognized and accepted by the
United Nations system as a valuable contribution to
our collective efforts. In that regard, Tuvalu calls
upon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, to recognize and allow Taiwan to participate
in and contribute meaningfully to their meetings and
activities without reservations.","However, our global efforts cannot be fully universal
until the United Nations pragmatically recognizes the
international contribution that the Republic of China on
Taiwan has made and the responsibility it has undertaken
to achieve the noble goals of the United Nations, as well
as the MDGs and SDGs, thus improving the standards
of living of millions all over the world. The Republic of China’s significant international participation in
United Nations specialized agencies, including in
the World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF,
the International Civil Aviation Organization, the
International Maritime Organization and the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
is critical as we collectively advance towards the
post-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable
development goals. ","Tuvalu also fully supports Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in United Nations specialized agencies and
mechanisms, including the World Health Organization,
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. We recognize the cooperative spirit shown by
Taiwan in its involvement in the post-2015 development
agenda dialogue. We recognize the need to include
Taiwan in the global fight against climate change. We also
recognize Taiwan’s role as a regional peacemaker. Taiwan
supports scholarships and capacity-building for experts,
students and officials from Tuvalu and many developing
countries.","Tuvalu also welcomes the efforts of the Government
of the Republic of China on Taiwan in fostering peace and
prosperity in the region and globally. The Government
and non-governmental organizations of Taiwan have
consistently supported various developmental and
humanitarian undertakings directly and through many
specialized United Nations bodies, such as the World
Health Assembly, the World Health Organization,
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. Taiwan’s infrastructure projects, technology
transfer and capacity-building have produced genuine
and tangible outcomes in Tuvalu. We can achieve the
ambitious goals we have set ourselves in Agenda 2030
only if all the permutations of partnerships are utilized
and honoured.","We are also concerned about the continuing denial
of the right of the 24 million people of the Republic of
China on Taiwan to be readmitted to United Nations
membership so that they can participate in the work
of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. We
need to recognize that Taiwan is a vibrant democracy,
which has recently elected and inaugurated a new
President. Taiwan’s genuine efforts in supporting
various developmental and humanitarian undertakings,
including in Tuvalu and many developing countries,
need to be recognized as well. As we embark on the
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), Taiwan’s direct and indirect support will
greatly help in leveraging existing partnerships. Taiwan
is already involved in the work of many specialized
United Nations bodies, such as the World Health
Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. We therefore truly believe that Taiwan
deserves international recognition and to become an
active member of and participant in all the bodies of
the United Nations system.","Our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is
universal and holistic in that it applies to all countries
and actors and covers all aspects of sustainable
development. Critically to its success, the agenda is
rooted in human rights and genuine partnerships.
But the vibrant democracy of Taiwan, which has long
been an active and responsible development partner
to many countries, including Tuvalu, is being denied
participation in the United Nations system. It cannot
be right that the twenty-second-largest global economy,
with a notable capacity to contribute, cannot effectively
participate in our 2030 Agenda. This is unfortunate,
given that our 2030 Agenda needs genuine global
partnerships to mobilize all available resources to
be successful. Under its principle of universality, the
United Nations should allow the 23 million people of
Taiwan to enjoy their fundamental right to participate
fully in the United Nations system and to benefit and
contribute effectively to its programmes.","The exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations
system has denied its 23 million people the enjoyment
of their fundamental rights to participate in and benefit
from the United Nations. Taiwan is already a responsible
and able partner with Tuvalu and many other countries
in many regions of the world, and could do even more if
it were allowed to assume its rightful place and role in
our global efforts to achieve sustainable development.
Tuvalu believes that the United Nations has to make the
arrangements necessary to enable Taiwan to participate
in meetings, activities and mechanisms within the
framework of United Nations processes, including those
of the relevant United Nations specialized agencies.
In a similar vein, we believe that the long-standing
unilateral economic embargo on trade with Cuba
directly constrains the development aspirations of the
people of that country. It neglects the human rights and
the spirit of cooperation espoused by the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. Likewise, we believe that
the United Nations must also engage with the people of
West Papua to find lasting solutions to their struggles.In August 2019, Tuvalu will host the fiftieth Pacific
Islands Forum of leaders. I extend our humble invitation
to all Pacific Island Forum leaders, our friends and
especially our bilateral and multilateral development
partners to join us in Tuvalu. It will still be there, I
hope. We want to put on record our deepest appreciation
to the Government of Taiwan for their generous support
in helping us prepare for that important and large-scale regional event. Similarly, I want to acknowledge similar
support from the Governments of India, Taiwan, and
the Republic of Korea in helping us host the next
year’s Forum. On 1 October, next Monday, Tuvalu will celebrate
its fortieth anniversary of independence. While holding
high our national pride as an independent nation, we
fully acknowledge that Tuvalu could never have achieved
such status without the due consideration of Members
of this body, to whom, on behalf of the people of
Tuvalu, I now offer our sincere gratitude. In our striding
forward, we acknowledge with deep appreciation, the
generosity of all our development partners, particularly
our traditional partners: the Republic of China, Taiwan,
India, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand,
the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and many
others. As we paddle our canoe forward for the next 40
years, we seek the continuing goodwill of the United
Nations family to further advance our achievements
based on genuine and durable partnerships.","Genuine and durable partnerships are fundamental
to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.
However, the exclusion of as genuine and durable a
partner as Taiwan from the United Nations systems
denied its 23 million people their fundamental rights
to participate in, benefit from and contribute to the
Sustainable Development Goals. Taiwan is already
a responsible and able partner to Tuvalu and many
countries around the world and could only do more if it
were invited to do so.
Tuvalu strongly supports the Republic of China’s
readmission into the United Nations as a founding
member of the Organization and its active participation
in the United Nations specialized agencies.","It is regrettable however that the Republic of China (Taiwan), with its exemplary
response to the pandemic continues to be kept out of the UN system. Taiwan has
managed the pandemic well and has reached a level comparable to OECD countries
on several SDG indicators. Taiwan is in a much better position than most to help the
international community build back better.
Tuvalu strongly supports the ROC’s readmission into the UN as a founding
member of the UN, and its active participation in UN specialized agencies including
the WHO and ICAO."
United Arab Emirates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Furthermore, the United Arab Emirates has long
and consistently been pursuing a foreign policy based
on the principles and purposes of the United Nations,
in particular with regard to the settlement of
international disputes by peaceful means,
non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the
protection of national sovereignty. In that context, we
affirm our continued commitment to the one-China
policy. ",,,,,,,,,,,
Vanuatu,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The question of Taiwan must also be adequately
addressed here. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted by
the General Assembly in 1971, resolved the legal and
political representation of the People’s Republic of
China as a Member of the United Nations. Therefore,
any attempt by Taiwan to gain admission to the United
Nations or to any of its affiliated organs or special
agencies will not be supported by my Government. The
United Nations must ensure that it does not become
involved in the conflict between China and Taiwan,
which is a matter totally within China’s purview.",,"On a final matter, my delegation strongly
reaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI),
which was adopted during the twenty-sixth session, in
1971, and which recognized the legal and political
representation of the People’s Republic of China as a
Member of the United Nations. Vanuatu again
reiterates its unwavering support for one China and
urges all members of the United Nations to work in the
interests of world peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
